<p class="drop-capi-B-quote">“Bouncers, Teddy! the roundest and
the rosiest. Drop them, quick! My
apron’s all ready for the darlings.”</p>

<p>“It’s very well to say drop <em>them</em>; but it’s
just as much as I can do to keep from falling
myself. Don’t you see I’m holding on with
both hands?”</p>

<p>“What a fuss you do make! Come down,
and let me try. I never saw a tree yet big
enough to scare me.”</p>

<p>“Who’s scart, Becky Sleeper? I ain’t&mdash;not
by a long chalk. When a feller’s holdin’ on
with both hands, he can’t be expected to pick
very quick&mdash;can he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wind your arm round that branch over your
head. There; now you’re all right, Teddy.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. What a hand you are to contrive!
Now look sharp&mdash;they’re coming!”</p>

<p>Becky Sleeper, in imitation of famed “Humpty
Dumpty,” sat upon a wall, where she had no
business to be, for the wall was the boundary
of Captain Thompson’s orchard. But there she
sat, her feet dangling, her hair flying, and her
hands holding her apron by its corners, intent
on catching the apples which her brother was
plucking from the tree above her head.</p>

<p>An active, wide-awake little body was the
girl who was acting as accessory to the crime&mdash;a
very common one&mdash;of robbing an orchard.
Every movement of her sprightly figure belied
the family name. Perched upon the wall, that
cool October morning, she might have sat as a
model for the Spirit of Mischief. A plump,
round, rosy face, with a color in the cheeks that
rivaled in brightness the coveted fruit above
her, blue eyes full of laughter, a pretty mouth,
with dissolving views of flashing teeth, teasing
smiles, and a tongue never at rest; a queer
little pug nose, that had a habit of twitching a
mirthful accompaniment to the merriment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
eyes and mouth, a profusion of light hair, tossed
to and fro by the quick motions of the head,&mdash;all
these combined to make a head-piece which
would have delighted an artist, brightened as it
was by a few straggling rays of sunshine, that
darted through convenient openings in the mass
of foliage above her head.</p>

<p>Miss Becky’s costume, however, did not furnish
a fitting finish to her face and figure, but,
on the contrary, seemed much the worse for
wear. A high-neck, blue-check apron showed
unmistakable signs of familiarity with grape and
berry juices; the rusty brown dress which peeped
out beneath it was plentifully “sown with
tares,” and had a rough fringe at the bottom
never placed there by the dress-maker; a pair
of stockings, once white, had the appearance of
having recently been dyed in a mud-puddle, and
a pair of stringless boots, which completed her
attire, were only prevented from dropping off by
an elevation of the toes.</p>

<p>With her diminutive figure, her mischievous
face, and her eager interest in the apple raid,
she might have been taken for a thoughtless,
giddy child. No stranger would have dreamed
she was a maiden with an undoubted right to
affix to her name, age sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Her companion was a year younger, but greatly
her superior in weight and measure, not much
taller, but remarkably round at the waist and
plentifully supplied with flesh. He lacked the
activity of his sister, but was ambitious to emulate
her achievements, and to that end panted
and puffed with remarkable vigor.</p>

<p>Becky was an adept in all <em>boyish</em> sports. She
could climb a tree with the activity of a squirrel,
ride a horse without saddle or bridle, pull a
boat against the swift current of the river, “follow
my leader” on the roughest trail, take a
hand at base ball, play cricket, and was considered
a valuable acquisition to either side in a
game of football.</p>

<p>Teddy admired the vigor of his sister, was
not jealous of her superior abilities, although he
was unlucky in his pursuit of manly sports. He
had to be helped up a tree, and very often lay
at the foot, when the helper thought he had
successfully accomplished his task. Horses generally
dropped him when he attempted to ride;
he always “caught crabs” in boats; was a “muffer”
at base ball, and in everybody’s way in all
sorts of games.</p>

<p>These two were companions in roguery, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were a terror to all respectable people in Cleverly
who possessed orchards which they valued
highly, or melon patches which they watched
with anxious care; for, no matter how high the
value, or how strict the watch, this pair of marauders
had excellent taste in selection, and
managed to appropriate the choicest and best
without leave or license.</p>

<p>Cleverly is a very staid, respectable, triangular
township on the coast of Maine, its southern,
or sea line about six miles in length, forming
the base of the triangle, with a small village&mdash;Foxtown&mdash;at
its eastern point, and a somewhat
more pretentious town&mdash;Geeseville&mdash;at its western
point. From these two places the division
lines ran, one north-east, the other north-west,
meeting on Rogue’s River, where a bridge makes
the apex of the triangle. The roads, however,
do not traverse these boundary lines. There is
a straight road from Foxtown to Geeseville,
passing over a bridge which spans the river
where it empties into the harbor. South of this
highway is known as the fore side, and here may
be found Captain Thompson’s shipyard, a short,
chunky wharf, where occasionally a packet lies,
and a blacksmith’s shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>A few rods west of the river another road
breaks from the highway and goes straight north.
This is the main street of Cleverly. Climbing a
hill from the fore side, the traveller, on entering
this street, will find on the left a tailor’s shop,
a country store, the post-office, then a dozen
houses, white, attractive, and roomy. On the
right, a row of neat and tidy houses, four in
number; then a carpenter’s shop, the church, a
small school-house, a more expansive “academy,”
several fine dwellings, then a long hill, at the
foot of which is a brick-yard, and, a few rods
farther, another settlement known as the “Corner.”
The distance between the fore side and
the Corner is about a mile, and between these
two points may be found the wealth, culture,
and respectability of the township.</p>

<p>There is abundance of thrift, with very little
“brag” about Cleverly. Rogue’s River turns a
paper mill, a woollen mill, and a nail factory.
Every season a vessel is launched from the ship-yard,
and every winter the academy is well filled
with students; every Friday night, winter and
summer, the vestry of the church is crowded
with an attentive audience, and every Sunday
the church is surrounded with horses and vehicles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of all sizes, varieties, and conditions; yet the
quiet of the place seems never broken. There is
much beauty, with little attempt at display,
about the town. Trees line the street, vines
climb about the houses, shrubs peep out at the
palings, and flowers bloom everywhere without
any seeming special assistance from the inhabitants.</p>

<p>There is very little change in the Cleverly of
to-day from the Cleverly of twenty years ago.
Then Captain Thompson’s house stood directly
opposite the church, a large, square, two-story
front, as grand as any in the place. At the
rear, a lower building, used as a kitchen, ran
out to one still lower, used as a wood-shed;
this, in turn, stretched out to another building,
used as a carriage-house, while the barn, of
larger proportions, swung at the end of all; so
that, approaching it from the side, the structure
had the appearance of a kite with a very long
tail to it. At the end of the stable was the kitchen
garden; beyond that, the orchard, and on the
stone wall which separates it from the lane,
which in its turn separates the whole place from
the woods, patiently sits Miss Becky during this
long description.</p>

<p>“Quick, Teddy! Three more will make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
dozen; and that’s as many as I can hold, they’re
such whoppers. O, dear! my arms ache now,”
said Becky, after Teddy had employed more
time than seemed necessary in plucking the
captain’s mammoth Baldwins.</p>

<p>“Don’t ache any more than mine do, I
guess,” grumbled Teddy; “and I’m all cramped
up, too. Don’t believe I’ll ever git down
agin.”</p>

<p>“O, yes, you will Teddy. You’re famous for
quick descents, you know. You always come
down quicker than you go up; and such graceful
somersets as you do make! It’s better than
the circus, any time, to see you;” and a merry
peal of laughter broke from Miss Becky’s lips.</p>

<p>“Becky, Becky! don’t do that!” cried Teddy;
“they’ll hear you up at the house. I
wouldn’t have Cap’n Thompson catch me in
this tree for a good deal, I tell you. He’s
promised me a whaling if he ever catches me
on his place.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be scart, Teddy. He won’t catch
you this time. I can see the house, and
there is not a soul stirring; and, besides, the
cap’n’s not at home.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Becky, somebody’s comin’. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
can feel it in my bones. I’m comin’ down;”
and Teddy made a frantic effort to free himself
from the crotch of the tree, into which he was
snugly fitted.</p>

<p>“Not until you make up the dozen, Teddy.
Don’t be a goose! I haven’t watched this tree
a week for nothin’. Cap’n Thompson’s gone to
the ship-yard. I saw him ride off an hour ago
on ‘Uncle Ned;’ and he never gets back till
dinner time when he goes there.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that, Tomboy!”</p>

<p>With a slight scream, Becky turned her eyes
from the camp of the enemy to the lane. Not
ten feet from her stood a white horse, and on
his back sat the dreaded enemy&mdash;Captain
Thompson. A lively trembling of the branches
overhead gave evidence that another party was
aware of the startling interruption to a projected
fruit banquet.</p>

<p>Becky looked at the captain. He had a
very red face; he seemed to be in a towering
passion, and was, evidently, searching his short,
stout body for a tone deep and terrible enough
with which to continue the conversation. She
looked at him with a smile on her face; but,
at the flash of his angry eyes, dropped hers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the apron which contained the proofs of guilt,
then stole a glance at her trembling accomplice,
straightened her little body, and looked defiantly
at the horseman.</p>

<p>“So, Tomboy, I have caught you in the act&mdash;have
I?” thundered the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, cap’n, you certainly have, this time,
and no mistake,” saucily answered the tomboy.
“S’pose we’ve got to catch it now. What’s
the penalty? Going to put us in the pound, or
lock us up in the barn?”</p>

<p>“Neither, Miss Impudence,” thundered the
captain. “I’ll horsewhip you both. Here, you,
Master Ned, come out of that tree, quick!
D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>That the delinquent did hear, and that he
was inclined to obey, was made manifest by a
rustling among the leaves, and the dull thud of
a heavy body as it struck the ground, for Master
Teddy, terrified at the angry voice of the captain,
had let go, and landed in a heap outside
the wall.</p>

<p>“Run, Teddy, run! Don’t let him catch
you!” cried Becky, in excitement, dropping her
apron.</p>

</div>

<p>The round and rosy spoils, being freed, followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the law of gravitation, and plumped one
after another on to the head of the prostrate
Teddy, who was groaning and rubbing his
elbows, with a very lugubrious face.</p>

<p>“If you stir a step, you imp of mischief, I’ll
break every bone in your body,” cried the captain,
hastily dismounting, and approaching Teddy,
with a long riding-whip in his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch my brother! Don’t you
dare to touch my brother!” cried Becky from
her perch. “It’s a shame to make such a fuss
about a few apples!”</p>

<p>“It’s a great shame that a girl of your age
should be caught stealing apples,” replied the
captain.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t my fault. We shouldn’t have been
caught if you’d only staid at the yard.”</p>

<p>The captain almost smiled; the audacity of
the young depredator’s attempt to shift the responsibility
of the theft upon him, really tickled
him. Nevertheless, he approached Teddy, who,
having rubbed himself comfortable, now sat
calmly awaiting his fate.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?
Haven’t I told you to keep off my place?
Haven’t I given you sufficient warning? Haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I promised you a thrashing if I caught you
here&mdash;hey?” roared the captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, cap’n, you did. But I couldn’t help
it. I&mdash;I&mdash;I didn’t want the apples; b&mdash;b&mdash;but
I wanted to climb the tree for fun; its such
a hard climb, and&mdash;and&mdash;” stammered Teddy,
eyeing the whip.</p>

<p>“Don’t lie, you imp. There’s my apples all
round you. You shall sweat for this, I promise
you. Off with your jacket, quick! D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Don’t strike him, cap’n; please don’t. He’s
not to blame;” and Becky plunged from the
wall, and stood between the captain and her
brother. “He didn’t want the apples&mdash;indeed,
he didn’t. He don’t like apples&mdash;do you, Teddy?”</p>

<p>Teddy shook his head energetically, with a
contemptuous look at the fruit.</p>

<p>“I helped him up the tree, and I’m to blame
for it all. You oughtn’t to strike a boy for
doing all he can to please his sister. If you
must whip somebody, take me.”</p>

<p>“Stand out of the way, Tomboy. Your time
will come soon enough&mdash;never fear.” And he
pushed her from the path. “Off with that jacket.
D’ye hear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy coolly unbuttoned his jacket, and threw
it on the grass.</p>

<p>“Don’t tease him, Becky. I’m not afraid of
his whip. If it’s any fun for him, let him lay
on. I guess I can stand it as long as he can;”
and Teddy looked defiantly at his adversary.</p>

<p>Becky ran to her brother, and threw her arms
about his neck, to shield him from the whip.</p>

<p>“He shan’t strike you, Teddy. It’s all my
fault. He shan’t touch you.”</p>

<p>Captain Thompson was an obstinate man.
When he made up his mind to the doing of an
act, nothing could stand in his way. Perhaps
this accounted for the coolness of Teddy in the
trying situation in which he was placed, who,
remembering his promise, knew it must be fulfilled,
and so offered no resistance.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Becky. D’ye want to smother a feller?
Don’t be a ninny. It’s got to come. Go
home&mdash;do.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. He shall kill me before he strikes
you.”</p>

<p>Becky’s devotion was blighted in an instant,
for the angry man seized her by the arm and
flung her across the lane. She fell to the
ground unhurt, for the grass was thick and soft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll teach you to meddle. Don’t come near
me till I’ve done with him. Mind that.”</p>

<p>Becky sprang to her feet, fire flashing from
her eyes. She was as angry now as her tormentor.
She picked up a stone, and despite his
warning, approached the captain. He should
not strike her brother, she looked at the house;
no one in sight. Down the lane; no one&mdash;yes,
there stood Uncle Ned, cropping the grass, unmindful
of the group. Ah, the horse! There
was a chance yet to save her brother.</p>

<p>“Now, you scamp, I’ll teach you to rob
orchards!” and the whip was raised.</p>

<p>Spry as a cat, Becky was at the captain’s
back in an instant. She jumped and caught the
whip from his hand, then ran for the horse.
The captain quickly turned; but too late. Becky
sprang to the saddle, caught up the rein, lashed
the horse, turned, and shouted, “Good by,
Teddy! Good by, cap’n!” and galloped down
the lane.</p>

<p>“Come back, come back, you imp of mischief!
Come back, I say,” shouted the captain,
running after her.</p>

<p>“Some other time, cap’n; can’t stop now.
Good by;” and the saucy girl turned, waved her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hand to the maddened and baffled owner of
the Baldwins, plied the whip briskly, and was
out of sight.</p>

<p>The captain, with a muttered “Hang it!”&mdash;which
was the extent of his swearing, for he
was a deacon,&mdash;followed at as rapid a pace as
he could command, leaving Teddy solitary and
alone.</p>

<p>The fat boy looked after his persecutor a
moment, with a smile upon his face, then rose,
picked up his jacket, put it on, buttoned it at
the bottom, then coolly picked up the trophies
of victory, tucked them into his jacket and his
pockets, crossed the lane, crept through a hedge,
and disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="mediumfont">FALLEN FORTUNES.</span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p022.jpg" width="54" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-A-quote">“A stern chase is a long chase;” so,
leaving Captain Thompson in pursuit
of the fugitive, we will take the
liberty of passing through his premises to the
main street. At the left of the church, opposite
his house, another road ran down a steep
hill, crossed Rogue’s River, by a bridge, ran up
another hill, and wound round into the Foxtown
road. At the top of the second hill stood
a small brown house, by no means attractive in
appearance, being destitute of paint, climbing
vine, flowers, or other ornamentation. It had
not even the virtue of neatness to recommend
it. The gate was off its hinges, and lay
in the road. A crazy barn close by had a pitch
towards the river, as though from sheer weakness
it was inclined to lie down for rest, while
the scanty patch of cabbages and beets, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
potato hills, few and far between, and the rickety
bean-poles, all had a starved and neglected
appearance.</p>

<p>This was known as the “Sleeper Place,” being
occupied by Mrs. Sleeper and the young
people, Rebecca and Edward, better known as
Becky and Teddy. Inside, the house was not
much more attractive than the outside. On the
lower floor were four rooms, separated by the
entry, from which a flight of stairs, hidden by a
door, led to the garret above. On one side was
a kitchen, with a door leading into Mrs. Sleeper’s
bed-room at the back. On the other side
was a sitting-room, with a door leading to
a bed-room back of that, known as Becky’s
room. Teddy’s quarters were above, under the
roof. The house was scantily furnished with
old-fashioned furniture and home-made carpets,
all of which had seen their best many years before,
and now showed veteran scars of long
service.</p>

<p>In the kitchen were two females&mdash;Mrs. Sleeper
and Hulda Prime. Mrs. Sleeper was a small,
slender woman, with a face from which much
beauty had faded out, a face which bore but
one expression at all times&mdash;that of anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
expectation. All else had died out five years
before. Then she was a bright, cheerful, active
wife, merrily singing over her household cares.
Now she was waiting, for time to determine
whether she was a wife or a widow.</p>

<p>In ’49, when the California gold fever attacked
so many New England towns, Captain Cyrus
Sleeper was returning from the West Indies
with a cargo of sugar and molasses, in the new
ship “Bounding Billow,” the joint property of
himself and Captain Paul Thompson. Touching
at Havana, he was made acquainted with the
startling news of gold discoveries; and, always
impetuous, at once turned the bow of his ship
towards California.</p>

<p>A year passed, and Captain Thompson also
received startling news. His runaway partner
had reached California, disposed of his cargo at
fabulous prices, and sent the ship home in charge
of his mate, and had started for the mines. To
his partner he remitted the whole amount received
for his cargo,&mdash;enough to build two ships like
the Bounding Billow,&mdash;one half of which, being
his own, was to be held by his partner for the
support of his family until his return.</p>

<p>The captain was astounded. The conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
his partner was so strange, he believed he must
have lost his reason, and never expected to hear
any intelligence of him again. Mrs. Sleeper also
received a message from her eccentric husband,
full of glowing descriptions of quick fortunes
made in El Dorado, hopes of speedy return, and
bright pictures of the high life they would lead
when “his ship came in.” Since that time
nothing had been heard of Captain Cyrus Sleeper
or his fortunes.</p>

<p>The ship was fitted for a second voyage to
the West Indies, Mrs. Sleeper, by Thompson’s
advice, going shares with him in the venture.
But it proved disastrous. The ship was wrecked
on her return, and Mrs. Sleeper found herself
obliged to live on a very small income. Of a
very romantic nature, her sailor husband always
a hero in her eyes, for a little while she had
high hopes of his quick return with an ample
fortune, and chatted gaily of the good time
coming “when her ship came in.” But as time
passed, and no message came from over the sea,
the smile forsook her lips, the brightness her
cheek, and the hope-light of her eyes changed
to an eager, searching glance, that told of an
unquiet mind and an aching, breaking heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>She went about her household duties, cooked,
scrubbed, and mended, quietly and silently, but
took no pride in her home, no comfort in her
children. The house soon showed evidences of
neglect. The children, without a mother’s sympathy
and guidance, were rapidly running to
waste.</p>

<p>Just when the money began to give out,
Hulda Prime “came to help.” Hulda was a
distant relative of Cyrus Sleeper, by her own
showing, as she was a distant relative of almost
everybody in Cleverly. She was somewhere between
forty and sixty: it was hard telling her
age. It could not be told by her hair, for she
had none; nor yet by her teeth, for they were
false, or her cheeks, for they were always bright,
and had a natural color which some people were
wicked enough to say was not natural. She was
long-favored, long and lean in body, had a very
long face, long nose, and a long chin. She wore
a “front,” with two auburn ringlets dangling at
either end, a very tall white cap, carried herself
very erect, and had altogether a solemn and
serious demeanor. She left a “relative” to
come and help “dear Delia in her troubles;”
though in what her help consisted was a puzzle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which the good people of Cleverly had never
been able to solve. She got her living by “helping.”
She had no money, but she had a large
stock of complaints, so many, that they might
have been calendared thus: Monday, rheumatism;
Tuesday, cancer; Wednesday, dyspepsia;
Thursday, heart disease; Friday, lumbago; Saturday,
“spine;” Sunday, neuralgia. Or to vary
the monotony, she would start off Monday with
“cancer,” or some other disease; but the week
would contain the whole programme. She was
very regular in her habits&mdash;of complaining, and
was always taken bad just when she might be
of assistance.</p>

<p>This day she was crouched by the fire, her
head tied up in a towel, her body slowly rocking
to and fro. It was her neuralgia day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sleeper stood at her wash-tub near the
window, her hands busy in the suds, her eyes
fixed on the distant waters of the bay, her
thoughts away with the ship that never came in.
So absorbed was she in her “waiting” dream,
that she did not see Captain Thompson, who
for the last ten minutes had been puffing up the
hill in sight of the window; was not aware of
his approach until he stood in the kitchen doorway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with both hands braced against the sides,
breathing very hard.</p>

<p>“So, so! Pur&mdash;pur&mdash;purty capers those
young ones of yours are cutting up, Delia
Sleeper!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sleeper turned with a start; Aunt Hulda
straightened up with a groan.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Rebecca and Edward, captain?
Have they been making any trouble?” said Mrs.
Sleeper, with the faintest sign of interest in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Trouble, trouble!” shouted the captain, so
loud that Aunt Hulda gave a groan, and held
her head very hard; “did they ever make anything
else? Ain’t they the pests of the town?
Who or what is safe when they are about? I
tell you what it is, Delia, I’m a patient man, a
very patient man. I’ve endured this sort of
thing just as long as I mean to. I tell you
something’s got to be done.” And the captain
looked very red, very angry, and very determined.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I try to keep the children out of
mischief,” faltered Mrs. Sleeper.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t. That’s just what’s the matter.
You’ve no control over them. You don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
want to control them. You just let them loose
in the town, like a couple of wildcats, seeking
whom they may devour. What’s the consequence?
Look at Brown’s melon patch! He
couldn’t find a sound melon there. Look at my
orchard! Despoiled by those barbarians! Here’s
a sample. To-day I caught them at one of my
trees, loaded with plunder; caught them in the
act!”</p>

<p>“O, captain! you did not punish them!”</p>

<p>“Punish eels! No; they were too sharp for
me. One ran off with my horse, and a purty chase
I’ve had for nothing. The other marched away
with my fruit. But I will punish them; be
sure of that. Now, Delia, this thing must be
stopped; it shall be stopped. I’m a man of my
word, and when I say a thing’s to be done, it
is done.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m willing to do anything I can
to keep them orderly,” began Mrs. Sleeper.</p>

<p>“Now what’s the use of your talking so?
You know you’re not willing to do anything of
the kind. You’re all bound up in your sorrows.
You won’t think of the matter again when I’m
gone&mdash;you know you won’t. If you cared for
their bringing up, you’d have that boy at school,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
instead of letting him fatten on other folks’s
property, and bring that girl up to work, instead
of lettin’ her go galloping all over creation
on other folks’s horses. I tell you, Delia Sleeper,
you don’t know how to bring up young
ones!”</p>

<p>The captain, in his warmth, braced himself
against the door sills so energetically that they
cracked, and a catastrophe, something like that
which occurred when Samson played with the
pillars of the temple, seemed imminent.</p>

<p>“P’raps she’d better turn ’em over to you,
Cap’n Thompson,” growled Aunt Hulda; “you’re
such a grand hand at bringin’ up!”</p>

<p>“Hulda Prime, you jest attend to your own
affairs. This is none of your business; so shet
up!” shouted the more plain than polite captain.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” retorted Aunt Hulda. “Wal, I
never! Ain’t you gettin’ a leetle <em>obstroperlous</em>,
cap’n? This here’s a free country, and nobody’s
to hinder anybody’s freein’ their mind to anybody,
even if they are a little up in the world.
Shut up, indeed!” And Aunt Hulda, in her
indignation, rose from her chair, walked round
it, and plumped down again in her old position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want any of your interference, Hulda
Prime.”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t. But it’s enough to make
a horse laugh to see you comin’ here tellin’
about bringin’ up young uns! Brought up your
Harry well&mdash;didn’t yer?”</p>

<p>“Hush, Aunt Hulda; don’t bring up that
matter now,” said Mrs. Sleeper.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Aunt Hulda, whose neuralgia
was working her temper up to a high
pitch. “When folks come to other folks’s houses
to tell ’em how to train up their children, it’s
high time they looked to home.”</p>

<p>“I brought up my son to obey his father in
everything, and there wasn’t a better boy in the
town.”</p>

<p>“I want to know! He was dreadful nice
when you had him under your thumb, for you
was so strict with him he darsn’t say his soul
was his own; but he made up for it when he
got loose. Sech capers! He made a tom-boy
of our Becky, and was jest as full of mischief
as he could stick.”</p>

<p>“No matter about my son, Hulda Prime; he’s
out of the way now.”</p>

<p>“Yes; cos you wanted to put him to a trade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
after he’d been through the academy. He didn’t
like that, and started off to get a college education,
and you shut the door agin him, and you
locked up your money, and vowed he should
starve afore you’d help him. But they do say
he’s been through Harvard College in spite of
yer.”</p>

<p>“Hulda Prime, you’re a meddlin’ old woman,”
roared the captain, thoroughly enraged, “and
it’s a pity somebody didn’t start you off years
ago&mdash;hangin’ round where you ain’t wanted.”</p>

<p>“I never hung round your house much&mdash;did
I, cap’n?” cried Aunt Hulda, with a triumphant
grin, which evidently started the neuralgic
pains, for she sank back with a groan.</p>

<p>While this passage of tongues was going on
inside the house, Miss Becky appeared in the
road, mounted on Uncle Ned, who looked rather
jaded, as though he had been put to a hard
gallop. Flinging herself from his back she entered
the door, when the form of Captain Thompson,
braced in the kitchen door-way,&mdash;which position
he had not forsaken even in the height of
debate,&mdash;met her eyes. Her first thought was
to regain the safe companionship of Uncle Ned;
but a desire to know what was going on overcame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
her sense of danger, and she gently lifted
the latch of the door which opened to the garret
stairs, and stepped inside. The warlike parties
in the kitchen covered her retreat with the
clamor of their tongues.</p>

<p>“Now, Delia, I want you to listen to reason,”
continued the captain, turning from the vanquished
spinster to the silent woman, who had
kept busily at work during the combat. “You’re
too easy with them children. They want a strong
hand to keep them in line. Now you know I’m
a good friend to you and yours; and though
Cyrus Sleeper treated me rather shabbily&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My gracious! hear that man talk!” blurted
out Aunt Hulda. “It’s no such thing, and you
know it. You made more money out of his
Californy speculation with that air ship than
you ever made afore in your life.”</p>

<p>“Will you be quiet, woman?” roared the
captain. “I ain’t talkin’ to you, and don’t want
any of your meddlin’.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Hulda, don’t interrupt, please,” said
Mrs. Sleeper; “let’s hear what the captain has
to say.”</p>

<p>“Then let him talk sense. The idea of Cyrus
Sleeper’s ever treating anybody shabby! It’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ridikerlous!” growled Aunt Hulda, as she returned
to her neuralgic nursing.</p>

<p>“The young ones want a strict hand over
’em,” continued the captain, when quiet was
restored again. “I’m willing to take part charge
of them, if you’ll let me. They must be sent
to school.”</p>

<p>“I can’t afford it, captain. I couldn’t send
’em last year. You know the money’s most
gone,” said Mrs. Sleeper.</p>

<p>“I know its all gone, Delia. What you’ve
been drawing the last year is from my own
pocket. But no matter for that. Drinkwater
opens the school Monday. I’ll send the children
there, and pay the bills. It’s time something
was done for their education; and I’ll be a
father to them, as they’re not likely to have
another very soon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, don’t say that! Cyrus will
come back&mdash;I know he will.”</p>

<p>“If he’s alive. But don’t be too hopeful.
There’s been a heap of mortality among the
miners; and if he’s alive, we should have heard
from him afore this. Chances are agin him. So
you’d better be resigned. Yes, you’d better give
him up, put on mourning for a year, and then
look round, for the money’s gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give up my husband!” cried Mrs. Sleeper,
with energy. “No, no. He will come back; I
feel, I know he will. He would never desert
me; and if he died,&mdash;O, Heaven, no, no!&mdash;if
he died, he would find some way to send his
last words to me. No, no, don’t say give him
up. I cannot, I cannot!” and the poor woman
burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Wal, I never!” cried Aunt Hulda. “Look
round, indeed! Why, it’s bigamy, rank bigamy!”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the captain, quickly, anxious
to avoid another battle, “do as you please
about that; but let’s give the children a good
bringing up. They’ve got to earn their own
living, and the sooner they get a little learning
the better.”</p>

<p>“The children should go to school, captain,
I know,” said Mrs. Sleeper; “but I’m afraid
they will not take kindly to the change.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make ’em, then. It’s time they were
broke, and I flatter myself I’m able to bring ’em
under control. But make no interference with
my plans. Once begun, they must stick to
school. It’s for their good, you know.”</p>

<p>“Very well, captain; I consent; only be easy
with them at first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, I’ll be easy enough, never fear, if they
mind me; if not, they must take the consequences.
So, next Monday fix ’em up, and I’ll
take ’em over, and talk to Drinkwater.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have them all ready, captain, and thank
you for the trouble you’re taking,” said Mrs.
Sleeper.</p>

<p>“Now, mind! no interference from you or
Hulda. If there is&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret yourself about me, cap’n. Mercy
knows I’ve trouble enough of my own. I declare,
there’s that lumbago comin’ on agin,” groaned
Aunt Hulda.</p>

<p>The captain seemed highly delighted at the
prospect of a change in the condition of his
enemy, and, with a triumphant smile, backed
into the entry.</p>

<p>“Hallo! there’s my horse, reeking with sweat.
Where is that imp of mischief?” thundered the
exasperated captain. “If I catch her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here I am, cap’n. Clear the coast! Ha,
ha, ha! Hooray!”</p>

<p>The voice came from the garret. There was
a thundering racket on the stairs, a crash against
the door, which flew open, and Becky, seated
in an old cradle without rockers, burst into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
entry. Tired of listening, she had searched the
garret for sport, had dragged this old emblem
of infancy from its hiding-place to the head of
the stairs, seated herself in it, and, regardless
of consequences, started for a slide.</p>

<p>It was a reckless act. As the door flew open,
the cradle struck the captain’s shins, throwing
him backwards, and pitching Becky out of the
front door on to the grass. The captain scrambled
to his feet, furious with pain and choler.
Becky regained hers quickly and started for the
barn, the captain in hot pursuit. Another stern
chase. The captain soon desisted, mounted his
horse, and rode away, while Miss Becky perched
herself on the rickety fence, and saluted the
captain’s ears, as he rode down the hill, with
the refrain of the well-known song, “O, dear,
what can the matter be?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">MRS. THOMPSON’S CROSS.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p038.jpg" width="41" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-T">The captain cantered home in no enviable
state of mind. His mission had been
successful, in as much as he had gained
Mrs. Sleeper’s consent to his plan for “tying
up” her children. Otherwise he felt unhappy
regarding the events of the day. There were
still stinging pains in his ankles and back to
remind him of Miss Becky’s exploit, and the
shrill, sarcastic voice of Hulda Prime still rang
in his ears. That so miserable a creature as he
considered her should have dared to criticise his
conduct was peculiarly mortifying to his pride.
Aunt Hulda had, indeed, spoken boldly. He
was, undoubtedly the greatest man in Cleverly.
Senior deacon in the church, moderator at town
meetings, referee in all disputes, and general
adviser of his fellow-townsmen, he was a man
to be treated with respect, a man who would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
brook no interference with his plans, a man
whose opinions must not be combatted, and one
whom people did not think it safe to thwart.
And this poor old hanger-on at people’s firesides
had dared to criticise a proceeding which others
had not the courage to mention in his presence.
And he had not the power to punish her. Poor
Aunt Hulda was never thought so much of
before by a man as she was by the captain during
his homeward ride.</p>

<p>Gloomily he rode into the yard, and consigned
Uncle Ned to the care of Phil Hague, his man-of-all-work,
who advanced smiling, to meet him,
undeterred by the black looks of his master.</p>

<p>“By me sowl, cap’n, dear, it’s a fine lather
yez given owld Uncle Ned. Is it fur ye’ve
rode?”</p>

<p>“No,” shortly replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Thin what’s the matter wid
the baste? Shure he’s not looked so wary loike
since&mdash;since Master Harry&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you fool!” thundered the captain.
“It’s your business to take care of him, and not
to ask impertinent questions.” And he stamped
into the house, muttering, “Am I never to hear
the last of that boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil scratched his head, and looked after the
captain.</p>

<p>“Shure there’s an aist wind blowin’, an’ we’ll
have to be afther scuddin’ under bare poles,
jist.”</p>

<p>Gloomily the captain stalked through the various
sections of his establishment, until he reached
the front sitting-room, and found himself in the
presence of his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson was the queen of Cleverly
society. The mention of her name in any company
was enough to make the most silent
tongue suddenly eloquent. She was plump in
person and plump in virtues. Her face was just
round and full enough to please everybody. No
one had such rosy cheeks as Mrs. Thompson,
“at her time of life too!” There was the kindliest
light in her grey eyes, and the jolliest
puckers about her mouth; and the short gray
curls that flourished all over her head formed a
perfect crown of beauty&mdash;nothing else. Cleverly
folks were proud of her, and well they might
be. She was everybody’s friend. She not only
ministered to the wants of the needy, but she
sought them out. She was the first at the bedside
of the sick, and the last to give them up, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she was as well skilled in domestic medicine as
she was in domestic cooking, and superior in
both. She was a wondrous helper, for she knew
just where to put her hands, and an enchanting
talker, for she never spoke ill of anybody. She
was a devout sister of the church, promulgating
the true religious doctrines of faith, hope, and
charity with no sanctimonious face, but purifying
and warming with the incense of good deeds
and the sunshine of a life cheerful, hopeful, and
energetic. She had her cross to bear&mdash;who has
not?&mdash;but she so enveloped it in the luxuriant
branches of the tree of usefulness rooted in her
own heart, that its burden lay easy on her
broad, matronly shoulders.</p>

<p>On the captain’s entrance she was seated in
a low rocking-chair, darning one of her husband’s
socks. She looked up, with a smile upon
her face.</p>

<p>“Ah, father! back early to-day!”</p>

<p>“Father!” snapped the captain, as he flung
himself upon a sofa. “Why will you insist on
calling me by that name? Haven’t I repeatedly
asked you not to?”</p>

<p>“So you have Paul, so you have; and I’ve
repeatedly disobeyed you,” cheerfully answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the good woman. “I didn’t mean to; but
women are so forgetful! I’ll be more careful in
future, fath&mdash;Dear me, there it is again!”</p>

<p>“There, there! what’s the use of talking to
you? But I won’t have it. I tell you I’m no
father. I won’t be a father. When that boy
took the reins in his own hands, I cut him out
of my heart. I’ll never, never own him!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson bit her lips. Evidently the
cross was bearing down hard upon her. Only an
instant, and the smile came back.</p>

<p>“You rode up from the bridge. Been over
to Delia’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been over to Delia’s. That woman,
and that woman’s young ones, will drive me
crazy.”</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t go over there, if I were
you. Let me be your messenger in future.”</p>

<p>“No, marm. I’ve taken this case into my own
hands, and I mean to finish it. When Sleeper
disappeared, I told you not to go near them,
for I knew that you would be just foolish
enough to fix them up so comfortably, she would
lead an idle life; and I wasn’t going to have
anything of the kind going on. She’s got to
come to hard work, and she might as well commence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
first as last. Its a mystery to me how
she’s got along so well as she has.”</p>

<p>It was no mystery to Mrs. Thompson. She
had been forbidden to go, but not to send; and
many and heavy had been the burdens her messengers
had carried across the river to the little
brown house on the hill.</p>

<p>“But I’ve settled things now,” continued the
captain. “Next Monday the young ones go to
school.”</p>

<p>“Next Monday! No, no; don’t send them
then!” cried Mrs. Thompson, with a shade of
alarm in her manner.</p>

<p>“And why not? I’d like to know. Next
Monday the term begins.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but&mdash;but hadn’t you better wait a few
days?”</p>

<p>“Wait? wait? I won’t wait a moment after
the doors open. Next Monday they go, bright
and early.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Paul,” said Mrs. Thompson,
with a sigh. “How is Delia? looking
well?”</p>

<p>“No; she looks bad. Think she might, with
that grumbling old crone fastened on to her.”</p>

<p>“Old crone! Why, Paul, whom do you
mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hulda Prime. She’s dropped in there to
‘help!’ Help make her miserable; that’s all
she’ll do. Plaguy old busybody, meddling in
other people’s affairs! I wish the town was well
rid of her.”</p>

<p>“She is rather an encumbrance&mdash;that’s a
fact,” quietly replied Mrs. Thompson. “But
we are never troubled with her.”</p>

<p>“She knows better than to come near me,”
said the captain, with a wise shake of the head.
“Why, she had the impudence to taunt me with
having turned my own son out of doors!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said his wife, hardly able to conceal
a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, she did; and she’d heard that, spite of
me, the boy had gone through college. Plague
take her!”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Well, Aunt Hulda never picks her
words. She is sometimes very aggravating.”</p>

<p>“Aggravating! She’s insolent. The idea of
her daring to talk so to me! O, if there was
only a law to shut the mouths of such meddling
old tattlers, I’d spend every cent I have but
what I’d lock her up where her voice could
never be heard!”</p>

<p>The captain, unable longer to keep quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
here rose, dashed about the room two or three
times, then darted out, and his angry tirade died
away in the distance as he made his way to the
barn.</p>

<p>Mrs Thompson sat quiet a moment, then
burst into such a merry peal of laughter that
the Canary in the cage above her head was
inspired, and burst into a torrent of song. The
audacity of Aunt Hulda seemed to affect Mrs.
Thompson far less severely than it did her husband,
for that was the cause of her mirth.</p>

<p>Had Captain Thompson really been a bad
man, his frequent outbursts of passion might
have terrified, and his fierce threats have pained
her; but a long acquaintance with the defect in
his otherwise good disposition had made these
stormy passages too familiar to be dreaded. His
one defect&mdash;Mrs. Thompson’s cross&mdash;was obstinacy.
Give the man his own way, and he was
ready for any good act or work: thwart him
in the slightest particular, and he was immovable.
And so Mrs. Thompson, like a wise
woman, never openly arrayed herself against his
wishes or opinions. And yet the captain would
have been astonished, had he calmly investigated
the matter, to find how seldom he really had his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
own way. This shrewd woman knowing it was
useless to combat his stubborn spirit, was continually
setting up safety-rods to attract this
destructive fluid where it could do no harm;
contriving plans for him to combat, herself triumphing
in their downfall, while he exulted in
his supposed victory.</p>

<p>Miss Becky’s career was a case in point. She
had been pained to see and hear of the girl’s
wild, mischievous pranks, and felt it was time
she should be sent to school. She took occasion
one day when, in sight of the window, Becky
had climbed up the lightning-rod on the church,
and seated herself in a window over the door, to
call her husband’s attention to the fact, with the
remark that “such exercise must be excellent
for a girl’s constitution.” The captain fired up
at once, denounced such tomboy tricks, and
declared the girl should go to school, or he’d
know the reason why.</p>

<p>And so thanks to Mrs Thompson, and not her
husband, Becky was to be turned from the error
of her ways. The captain was a liberal man;
his purse was always open to the demands of
his wife. She might cover every bed in the
parish with comforters, clothe the poor, and feed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the hungry, to her heart’s content; he would
never stop to count the cost. And so she often
managed to repair damages his temper had
caused, out of his own purse.</p>

<p>But the man’s obstinacy had brought one serious
disaster, which she found all her woman’s
wit necessary to repair. It had driven their
only child from his home, and made a breach
between father and son which might never be
healed.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson, at the age of fifteen, was a
leader among the boys of Cleverly. He was
brave, skilful, and mischievous. He was looked
upon as a hero by his playfellows, whom he
could incite to the performance of wonderful
gymnastic feats, or to the perpetration of boyish
tricks hardly as creditable. Among his enthusiastic
admirers was Becky Sleeper, then ten years
of age, whom, being a special favorite of his,
he took pains to train in all the sports with
which he was familiar. He was then attending
the school; no interested student, but very quick
and apt to learn, standing fair in his class. The
next year he was sent to the academy; and a
suddenly-acquired taste for learning so fired his
ambitious spirit that at the end of the second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
year he graduated at the head of his class, with
the reputation of being a remarkable scholar.
Then, hungry for knowledge, he wanted to go
to college. But Captain Thompson had already
planned a course for his son. He had book-learning
enough; he wanted him to be a practical man.
He should go into the yard and learn the trade
of a ship-carpenter; in time he could be a
builder; and then the son could build, and the
father would fit out and send his ships abroad.</p>

<p>The son demurred. The father’s obstinacy
asserted itself; he could not be made to listen
to reason; and the matter ended by the boy’s
proclaiming his determination to go through college,
if he had to scrub the floors to get through,
and the father’s threat that, if he left home,
the doors should be closed against his return.</p>

<p>The boy went. The mention of his name
was forbidden in his home by the angry father.
He had been gone four years, and the captain
seemed as insensible to his welfare as he did
when he pronounced his dictum.</p>

<p>But the mother, she had not held her peace
for four long years without knowledge of her boy.
Snugly tucked away among her treasures were
weekly records of her son’s progress, in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
own handwriting&mdash;tender, loving epistles, such
as make a mother’s heart warm and happy, telling
of true growth in manhood’s noblest attributes,
and showing in every line the blessed power of
a mother’s influence.</p>

<p>Despite her cross, Mrs. Thompson was a happy
woman, and the championship of her son by
Aunt Hulda was a power to make her merry;
for she knew how her Harry got through college.
He didn’t scrub the floors to get through. O,
no! Captain Thompson’s purse paved the way
for a more stately march through the halls of
learning.</p>

<p>And so, having had her laugh, Mrs. Thompson
called, in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Silly!”</p>

<p>Silly, somewhere down in the tale of the kite,
answered the summons with a shrill “Yes,
marm,” and in a few minutes entered the room.</p>

<p>Priscilla York was one of Mrs. Thompson’s
charity patients&mdash;a tall, ungainly, awkward girl,
whom, from pity, the good woman had taken
into her house, with a desire to teach her a
few of the rudiments of housekeeping.</p>

<p>Silly was by no means a promising pupil, her
“breaking in” requiring the breaking up of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
many dishes and the exercise of much patience.</p>

<p>She was abrupt and jerking in her motion,
except when she walked; then she seemed afraid
of damaging carpets, not having been accustomed
to them, and walked on tiptoe, which peculiar
footfall caused the heels of her slip-shod shoes
to drop with a “clap-clap-clap,” as she crossed
the oil-cloth on the floor of the dining-room.
Her clothes hung loosely on her, and as she
entered the room her arms were stuck stiff at
her side, her mouth wide open, and her eyes
staring as though she expected to hear some
dreadful news.</p>

<p>“Silly,” said Mrs. Thompson, “get the
covered basket.”</p>

<p>“Yes, marm,” said Silly, and darted for the
door.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop, child; I’ve not finished.”</p>

<p>Silly darted back again.</p>

<p>“I want you to get the covered basket, and
take some things over to Mrs. Sleeper.”</p>

<p>“Yes marm;” and the girl darted for the
door a second time.</p>

<p>“Silly, stop this instant! What in the world
are you thinking of?”</p>

<p>“The covered basket, marm; it’s in the
pantry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silly, when I have finished what I want to
say, I will tell you to go.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want the covered basket,
marm?”</p>

<p>“Get the covered basket, put in it the ham
that was left at dinner, a pair of chickens I
cooked this morning, a couple of mince pies,
and a loaf of bread. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes marm. Basket, ham, chickens, mince
pie, bread,” said Silly, briskly.</p>

<p>“Very well. Those are for Mrs. Sleeper, with
my compliments.”</p>

<p>“Yes marm. Basket and all?”</p>

<p>“Bring back the basket, of course. Now
go&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, marm;” and Silly made a third dart
doorward.</p>

<p>“Stop, stop, Silly!”</p>

<p>“You told me to go when you said go; and
I was a going to go.”</p>

<p>“That was my mistake, Silly. I want you
to go to the pantry, get a bottle of currant
wine, a jar of damson preserves, and a box of
sardines. Can you find them all?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, marm. Currant wine, damson preserves,
sardines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well. Be careful in handling things.
Those are for Aunt Hulda, with my compliments.
Make no mistake, and be sure to tell
her I sent them. Now, Silly, go.”</p>

<p>Silly started at the word “go” so forcibly
that she ran plump against the portly form of
the captain, who just then entered.</p>

<p>“Hang it!” roared he; “why don’t you see
where you are going, stupid?”</p>

<p>“Stupid” stopped not to tell the reason why,
but darted by the captain: and soon a commotion
among the dishes in the pantry made it
evident that Silly was “handling things” none
to carefully.</p>

<p>“Where’s that crazy thing going now?”
muttered the captain, as he stalked to the
window.</p>

<p>“On one of my errands, Paul; so don’t be
inquisitive.”</p>

<p>Had he dreamed that Aunt Hulda’s defence
of his boy had turned his wife’s sympathies in
her direction, and that there was likely to be a
shower of goodies poured into the spinster’s
lap, he might have been inquisitive, instead of
shouting at that particular moment,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hang it! there’s that boy again! and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
my apples, too! He shan’t escape me this time.
No, no.” And the captain darted from the
room, and out into the road, bare-headed.</p>

<p>Teddy Sleeper had waited two hours, in the
woods behind the orchard the return of Becky,
supposing that, as she was the leader of the
expedition, after decoying the captain to a safe
distance, she would return to rescue her follower;
for Teddy had not sufficient reliance on
his own skill to venture either an attack or a
retreat. At last, getting weary, he crept out
into the lane, and from there into the main street,
and started for home. But as he neared the
church he was waylaid by a half a dozen of his
cronies, just returning from a game of base ball,
and, of course, very hungry. Catching sight of
the fruit stowed away in Teddy’s jacket, they
set up a roar of delight, and surrounded him.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Ted’s made a haul!”</p>

<p>“Divy’s the thing&mdash;hey, Ted?”</p>

<p>“O, come, Ted, don’t be mean.”</p>

<p>“But they ain’t mine; they’re Becky’s,” said
Teddy, warding off the snatches at his plunder
as best he could with his elbows.</p>

<p>“Becky’s&mdash;are they? Hooray! She won’t
care. Divy, Ted. She’s the best fellow in
town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy had about made up his mind to unbosom
himself to his captors, when he caught
sight of the bareheaded captain emerging from
the door. A shiver ran through him. Hardly
a chance for escape now. Nevertheless he darted
round the corner at a lively pace, and down the
hill. The disappointed boys, not having seen the
captain, but supposing Teddy was attempting
to escape from them, set up a yell, and started
in pursuit. But Teddy had made a good start,
and fear lent unwonted activity to his legs. So,
down the hill they went, Teddy ahead, the boys
close at his heels, and the captain dashing on
behind.</p>

<p>With such a load as he carried, Teddy could
not long keep up his gallant pace, and his pursuers
rapidly gained upon him. He was almost
to the bridge, and there was Becky cheering and
clapping her hands. If he could only reach her,
he felt he was safe. With a quick impulse, he
drew two apples from his bosom, and threw
them over his head. The foremost boy stopped
suddenly to pick them up. On a down grade,
too! The result was appalling. In an instant
he was on the ground, with his companions
piled upon him. A pitfall in the path of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
irate captain. His ponderous body launched itself
upon the heap, and great was the fall
thereof. Screams, groans, and dirt filled the
air as Teddy reached the bridge. The vanquished
picked themselves up as best they could,
without a thought of further pursuit, while the
conquering <em>heroes</em> marched up the hill, to make,
in some secure retreat, a fair division of the
spoils.</p>

<span class="mediumfont">BECKY SLEEPER’S CHARITY.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p056a.jpg" width="57" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-R-quote">“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep
it holy,” was a precept by no means
religiously observed at the little
brown house on the hill. Mrs. Sleeper had
never been a regular attendant at divine service,
even in her happiest days, and, since her
peculiar misfortune, had almost entirely neglected
the church. A part of the day was regularly
spent in poring over the letters of her husband,
the effect of which was to set her weeping for the
balance. The young people, left to their own
devices, amused themselves by pitching “quates”
behind the house, playing tag in the barn, or
by indulgence in other equally indecorous sports
endeavored to wear out the long day. Aunt
Hulda generally brought forth from their resting-place
at the bottom of her trunk “The Family
Physician,” or “Every Woman her own Doctor,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
two standard works for the cure of all diseases,
and faithfully consulting them for remedies to
meet her infirmities, or, from old habit, took the
ponderous family Bible into her lap, and in its
pages sought consolation, the Book of Job, however,
being the portion which really soothed her
perturbed spirit.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following the disaster on the
hill, the afflicted spinster, in the sitting-room,
was groaning over a treatise on cancer, in “The
Family Physician,” that disease being the order
of the day in her system of complaints. It was
near the middle of the afternoon, and Becky,
having exhausted the supply of out-door sports,
was lying upon the sofa, and, with a very dissatisfied
look upon her face, was watching Aunt
Hulda. Teddy, who seldom lost sight of his
sister, was flattening his nose against the window-pane.</p>

<p>“Aunt Hulda,” said Becky, suddenly, “don’t
you think Sunday is an awful long day?”</p>

<p>“I do, by hokey!” blurted out Teddy. “Can’t
get up no fun, nor nothin’. I’d like to go a
fishin’ first rate; but jest as you git a nibble,
long comes some the meetin’-house folks, and
begin to talk about breakin’ the Sabbath. And
that jest scares off all the fish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the fishermen, too, Teddy. My sakes,
how you did run last Sunday when Deacon Hill
caught you fishing down at the fore side!” said
Becky, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Plague take him! he jest marched off with
my line and bait, too,” growled Teddy. “It’s
none of his business, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All days are long to a poor, afflicted creeter,”
groaned Aunt Hulda. “But when I was
a girl of your age, I did think Sunday was as
long as six week-days beat into one; but then
it’s the Lord’s day, and I s’pose, after all, we
can make it long or short, just as we try to do
what he wants us to.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to know what he wants me
to do, for I can’t find out any way to make it
short. It’s just hateful, and I wish there wasn’t
any such day,” replied Becky, turning restlessly
about.</p>

<p>“Why, Rebecca Sleeper, how can you talk
so? One of the things he wants folks to do is
to go to meetin’ regular. You ought to know
that well enough.”</p>

<p>“Does he?” said Becky, with a mischievous
twinkle in her eye. “Seems to me, Aunt Hulda,
you don’t mind very well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lor, child, I’m a poor, afflicted creeter. He
don’t expect me to do much but bear my troubles
patiently; and I’m sure I do that,” said Aunt
Hulda, forcing a look of resignation into her
face.</p>

<p>“Don’t think much of goin’ to meetin’ anyhow,”
said Teddy. “They always pokes us up
in the gallery, and won’t let us go to sleep;
and if old Fox, the sexton, ketches a feller firin’
spitballs, he jest whacks him on the head.”</p>

<p>“Then there are other ways to make the day
short&mdash;readin’ the Bible and other good books.”</p>

<p>“Yes; ‘Family Physician,’ I s’pose,” said
Teddy. “I jest wish I had Robinson Crusoe:
that’s a first rate one.”</p>

<p>“Then a goin’ to see sick folks, and carryin’
’em little dainties, is another; and that makes
the day short, I tell you,” continued Aunt Hulda.
“When I was a helpin’ Mrs. Lincoln, years and
years ago, she used to say to me Sunday afternoons,
‘Hulda, don’t you want to clap on your
bonnet and run over to the widder Starns with
the basket?’ or, ‘Hulda, don’t you want to carry
this jelly round to Mr. Peters? He’s terrible
sick.’ And I used to go and go, and never feel
a bit tired, because it was charitable work; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Sundays used to go quicker than week-days, and
I was glad when they come round again. Now
there’s poor Mr. York, Silly York’s father; poor
man, he’s most gone with the consumption; now,
if you only had a nice little bit of somethin’
good to take over to him, you don’t know how
good you would feel, and how the time would
fly! O, dear, if I was only strong and well!
But what’s the use of talkin’? Here I’ve got
the rheumatics so I can’t walk, and the neuralogy
so I can’t sit still, and I’m afraid there’s a
cancer comin’ on the end of my tongue, and
then I can’t talk.”</p>

<p>Here Aunt Hulda ran out her tongue, and
commenced exploring it with her finger to find
a small pimple which had made its appearance
that day. Becky lay very quiet on the sofa,
watching Aunt Hulda, who, after the examination
of her tongue, plunged into “The Family
Physician” with anxious interest.</p>

<p>“Did she ever delight in doing good?” thought
Becky, as she studied Aunt Hulda’s face with
renewed interest. “Everybody calls her a nuisance,
and everybody laughs at her complaints.
She take nice things to sick folks, and feel good
in doing it! And she says this is the Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
day&mdash;this long, weary day,&mdash;and can be made
short and pleasant like the other six! Why,
she talks like a minister!”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda was a new being in the girl’s
eyes. She began to reverence the afflicted spinster.
She lay there so quiet that Teddy looked
round in astonishment. His sister had been lying
perfectly still for fifteen minutes. Such an
occurrence startled him.</p>

<p>“Becky, what’s the matter? Sick&mdash;hey?”</p>

<p>“No, Teddy,” replied Becky, startled in turn;
“I’m thinking&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it. ’Twill make you sick&mdash;see if
it don’t.”</p>

<p>“I guess not, Teddy,” replied Becky, jumping
up. “I’m going into the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Teddy followed her as she left the room.</p>

<p>“Teddy,” said Becky, solemnly, after she had
softly closed the kitchen door behind them, “I
expect we’re awful wicked.”</p>

<p>“Do you, though?” said Teddy, with staring
eyes. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Because Sunday’s such a long day. Didn’t
you hear what Aunt Hulda said? It’s the Lord’s
day, and we can make it short or long, just as
we try to do what he wants us to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what’s he want us to do?”</p>

<p>“To go to church, and not stay at home and
pitch quates.”</p>

<p>“How are we goin’ to church without clo’es?
My elbows are all out; so’s my knees. They’d
send us home quick, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they would,” replied Becky,
thoughtfully. “Well, there’s one thing we
might do&mdash;carry something nice to sick folks.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t got nothin’ nice, and don’t know
any sick folks,” replied matter-of-fact Teddy,
who failed to see anything time-shortening in
Becky’s project.</p>

<p>“We know Mr. York, who’s got the consumption.”</p>

<p>“Well, we might go and catch some fish and
take to him&mdash;only I’ve lost my line.”</p>

<p>“No; something better than that, Teddy.
Now you run and get a basket. I know what
to take.”</p>

<p>Teddy went into the wood-shed and soon
returned with a very dilapidated basket.</p>

<p>“That will do nicely. Now let’s see what we
can find to put into it,” said Becky, as she
opened the door of the cupboard. “Here’s a
bottle of currant wine; I guess that’s good for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
consumption; we’ll take that. And here’s a jar
of preserves; they always give them to sick
folks; we’ll take that. And here’s a box of sardines.
I don’t know about that. Well, we’ll
take it, any way.”</p>

<p>“Why, Becky, these things are what Mrs.
Thompson sent to Aunt Hulda,” said Teddy, a
little alarmed at Becky’s proceedings.</p>

<p>“So they are;” and Becky wavered a moment.
“No matter; she’ll send her some more, I guess.
Besides, Aunt Hulda won’t care, for we’re going
to do good with them. There’s a pair of chickens,
too; but I guess they’re most too hearty
for sick folks. Now let’s be off.”</p>

<p>With the basket between them, they crept
into the wood-shed, from there into a pasture
behind the house, crossed that, climbed a fence,
and struck into the Foxtown road. The Yorks
lived upon this road, a good mile and a half
from Mrs. Sleeper’s. The basket was a heavy,
unwieldy affair, in which the “good things”
bounced about in a very unsatisfactory manner;
and the couple “changed hands” many times
before they reached their destination.</p>

<p>In answer to Becky’s knock, the door was
opened by Mrs. York, a short, buxom woman
with a very pleasant face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Becky Sleeper&mdash;of all things! What in the
world brought you here? and what have you
got there?”</p>

<p>“Thought we’d come over and bring something
to Mr. York. He’s sick&mdash;ain’t he?”
answered Becky.</p>

<p>“Why, you good little soul! Come right in;
my poor man will be dreadful glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Becky and Teddy accepted the cordial invitation,
and were ushered into the presence of the
“poor man.” Mr. York was by no means so
far gone as people imagined. True, there were
about him symptoms of the dread disease which
New England makes a specialty; but he was a
very lazy man, and took advantage of any slight
cold to house himself and be nursed by his wife.
Mrs. York was not an idle woman; she washed,
ironed, and scrubbed in the neighborhood, when
her husband worked at his trade; the moment
he “felt bad” she dropped all outside labor,
and gave her attention to him, magnifying his
troubles by her sympathy, and thus making a
“baby” of a man who was strong enough to
support his family, had he the inclination. Of
course, in this state of affairs, there was no
income, and the active charity of Cleverly had
a loud call in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was neat and tidy; the “poor man”
lay upon a sofa; two of the five children with
which this couple were blessed were playing
about the room; two were at church; the eldest,
Silly, was in the next room, putting away her
things, having just returned from Mrs. Thompson’s.</p>

<p>“Only think, father, here’s Becky and Teddy
Sleeper come all the way alone to bring you
something nice. Of all things! Why, Becky,
I thought you didn’t care for anything but getting
into scrapes and out again. You’ve got a
good heart, any way&mdash;ain’t she father?”</p>

<p>Father raised himself on his elbow, with a
faint “Yes, indeed,” and fastened his eyes on
the basket, somewhat more interested in the
good things than in the good heart.</p>

<p>“Empty your basket right on to the table,
Becky. Did your mother send ’em?”</p>

<p>“No; mother’s sick,” replied Becky, a little
defiantly, for the allusion to scrapes had struck
her as not exactly polite under the circumstances.
“No, Mrs. York; I thought I’d pick
up something myself. Here’s a bottle of wine,
a jar of preserves, and a box of sardines,” placing
them upon the table. “If they will do Mr.
York any good, you’re welcome to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, they’re real nice, and we’re ever so
much obliged to you, Becky. Where did you
get them?”</p>

<p>Becky was silent a moment. She had not
expected such a question, was not prepared to
tell the truth, and would not lie, lying being
an infirmity which she detested; not, however,
from any prompting of her moral nature, but
because she thought it a cowardly way of getting
out of a scrape.</p>

<p>“Do you think it polite, Mrs. York, to ask
so many questions when people take the trouble
to bring you things?” she said, at last, with an
abused look in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, Becky,” replied Mrs. York,
with a laugh. “It’s real mean, and I’ll say no
more. You’re a dear, good girl, and you deserve
a better bringing up than you’re getting now.
Here’s Silly,&mdash;Silly, do look here; see what
these dear children have brought your father&mdash;wine,
preserves, sardines! Ain’t they kind?”</p>

<p>Silly stopped short in the doorway, and looked
in astonishment first at the table then at Becky.</p>

<p>“Wine, preserves, sardines! Becky Sleeper,
where did you get those things?”</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business,” replied Becky.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
“I didn’t come here to be asked questions.”</p>

<p>“O, you didn’t!” sneered Silly. “I know
where you got ’em: you stole ’em!&mdash;Mother,
they’re the very things Mrs. Thompson sent
over to Hulda Prime yesterday afternoon; and
I took ’em.”</p>

<p>“Land of liberty sakes! You don’t mean
it!” cried Mrs. York, with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>“Now, you young ones, take them things
right back!” cried Silly, stamping her foot and
jerking her arms about in an extraordinary
manner.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t send them back, Silly,” said her
father, with a faint hope of retaining the delicacies,
the sight of which had made his mouth
water. “Perhaps Hulda Prime sent ’em!”</p>

<p>“Hulda Prime, indeed! Ketch her parting
with her things; she’s too mean. No; they
shall go back, quick, too. What would Mrs.
Thompson say? Don’t you feel mean, Becky
Sleeper?”</p>

<p>From the color of Becky’s face it was evident
she was not contented with the situation. As
for Teddy, he was terrified, expecting every
moment the swinging arms of Silly would be
attracted to the vicinity of his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, off with you,” continued Silly, tossing
the articles into the basket; “and don’t you
ever show your faces here again. Purty capers
you cut up, Becky Sleeper,” picking up the
basket. “Here, take hold of it,” opening the
door. “Now, start yourselves, quick, or I’ll
know the reason why.”</p>

<p>Bang went the door, and the charitable party
were in the road, with the rejected offering still
upon their hands. They stood a moment looking
at each other and the closed door behind
them, Becky’s face crimson with shame, Teddy’s
eyes, now that he was out of danger, blazing
with anger.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” sputtered Teddy, “here’s a
purty kettle of fish. Nice scrape you’ve got us
in now, Becky Sleeper! You ought to know
better.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Hulda said this was the Lord’s work,”
answered Becky, meekly. “I was only trying
to make the day short and pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s the Lord’s work, you’ve made
a botch of it; and if he sent you here, he made
a mistake in the house.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so, Teddy; it’s wicked.”</p>

<p>“It’s wickeder to have to lug that basket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
way round home again. I won’t do it. Let’s
chuck it in the water.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Teddy; let’s take it home. I
wouldn’t have believed Silly York could be so
mean. Poor as they are, too!”</p>

<p>“I should think so! Folks don’t get sardines
and currant wine every day.”</p>

<p>“Come, let’s go the shortest way, Teddy.”</p>

<p>They took up the basket, and started homeward.
The shortest way was by the main street,
and as they entered it they met the people
coming from church. So, with down-cast faces,
the disappointed almoners ran the gantlet of
wondering eyes, attracted by the uncommon
sight of two poorly-dressed youngsters lugging
a heavy basket on Sunday.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Becky was mortified
at the condition in which she found herself.
As she passed neatly-dressed girls of her
own age, and heard the laughter which they
took no pains to suppress, her old, defiant manner
failed to assert itself, and she hung her
head in shame. To add to her humiliation,
when they reached the church, Captain Thompson
was standing on the steps talking with the
sexton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens and earth! What new caper’s
this?” he shouted, making a dash at the culprits.</p>

<p>Becky, having her head down, had not seen
the captain, but she heard his voice and recognized
it. She gave one startled look, dropped
the basket, and ran. Teddy was not slow in
following her example. The captain made a
motion as if to follow them, but giving a thought
to the day, and perhaps another to the steepness
of the hill they were rapidly descending, changed
his mind, picked up the basket, and entered his
house.</p>

<p>Becky and her accomplice made no stops until
they reached home. They dashed into the sitting-room,
breathless and frightened.</p>

<p>“Massy sakes! do you want to take the house
down?” cried Aunt Hulda. “What on airth’s
the matter now?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Hulda, I don’t believe you know a
thing about making Sunday short and pleasant,”
said Becky, indignantly. “I’ve tried it, and it’s
just as hateful a way of having a good time as
ever I saw.”</p>

<p>“Tried it! Tried what?” cried Aunt Hulda.</p>

<p>“Carrying nice things to sick folks, and getting
snubbed for your pains,” said Becky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and gittin’ yer shins barked with plaguy
big baskets,” added Teddy.</p>

<p>“Carrying things! What have you carried?
Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Currant wine, preserves and sardines!” sputtered
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, to Mr. York; and got turned out of
doors,” added Becky.</p>

<p>“Currant wine! Heavens and airth!” screamed
Aunt Hulda, jumping up and darting into
the kitchen with an activity she seldom displayed.</p>

<p>She flew to the cupboard, gave one look,
uttered a dismal groan, and darted back to the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>“You hateful young one, you’ve stolen my
things! What do you mean?” she cried, seizing
Becky by the shoulder, and shaking her.
“Is that the way you rob a poor, afflicted creeter?
What have you done with them? Where
are they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t care where they are! Wish they
were at the bottom of the river! Quit shaking
me!”</p>

<p>“Guess they’re safe, Aunt Hulda,” said Teddy,
with a grin. “Cap’n Thompson’s got ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cap’n Thompson!” gasped Aunt Hulda, staring
at Teddy. In his hands she felt they were
indeed safe. It was too much. She dropped
Becky, tottered to the sofa, and added a fit of
hysterics to the catalogue of her numerous ailments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">IN SCHOOL AND OUT.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p073.jpg" width="42" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-T">The dazzlingly white school-house opposite
Captain Thompson’s mansion was not
used for the public school, which,
under the state law, was necessarily kept in
operation at least four months in the year, and
for whose support the people of Cleverly were
taxed. That institution was situated at a point
nearer the fore side, a short distance from the
main street, and was in rather a dilapidated
condition. In those days country people had not
that pride in handsome and commodious school-houses
which is now eminently a characteristic
of New England villages; and this crazy edifice
was likely to serve the purpose for which it had
been erected, years and years before, until it
should crumble to pieces with age or be swept
into a pile of kindling-wood by the fury of a
March gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Thompson, as a member of the school
committee, had endeavored many times to have
the old shell supplanted by a better building, or
at least placed on a more secure footing; but
in vain. His associates&mdash;Messrs. Pennywise and
Poundfoolish&mdash;strictly opposed reconstruction in
any form.</p>

<p>“It was good enough for us; and what was
good enough for us is good enough for our
young ones,” was not a very sound argument;
but, as it satisfied the majority, the captain was
obliged to give way. He then carried the matter
before the town meeting, with no better
success. There was a strong opposition to any
measure he brought forward for the improvement
of the school estate. Not even a bundle
of shingles or a pound of nails could be had for
repairs. The “good-enough” argument prevailed
here; and the captain was vanquished.</p>

<p>Then his obstinacy asserted itself. He withdrew
from the school committee, bought the
land opposite his house, took men from his shipyard,
hired all the carpenters he could find, and
in less than two months had a very neat and
commodious school-house of his own. This he
leased to Rufus Drinkwater, the best teacher the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
public school ever had,&mdash;a man generally esteemed
by the good folks of Cleverly,&mdash;and commenced
a warfare against the ancient establishment.
Drinkwater’s term opened a month earlier
than the public, the charge for tuition was very
low, and the captain gave notice that he was
prepared to pay the bills, if children wanted to
come to “my school,” and parents felt unable
to incur further expense for schooling than that
to which they were subjected by the state tax.</p>

<p>The committee-men laughed when they saw
“Thompson’s Folly,” as they styled the new
edifice, going up. But when they saw the children
going in,&mdash;and a very respectable procession
they made,&mdash;and looked into their almost
deserted quarters, they groaned in spirit, forgot
the dignity of office, and railed in unbecoming
terms at the “underhand tricks” of their successful
opponent.</p>

<p>There was a satisfied look upon the captain’s
face as he stepped into the road Monday morning,
followed by his man-of-all-work. About the
door of the school-house were gathered a dozen
or so of young people, awaiting the appearance
of the teacher. It was only half past eight;
and this assembly at so early an hour gave
promise of a successful opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, well, little folks, this looks well, this
looks well,” said the great man, good humoredly,
as he entered the circle. “‘It’s the early
bird that catches the worm,’ and its the early
chicks that pick up the largest crumbs at the
bountiful table of learning.”</p>

<p>The “chicks” looked a little crestfallen as
the captain passed among them, patting a head
here, and chucking a chin there; for to boys
and girls ranging from ten to fifteen years of
age, these babyish appellations and familiarities
are not cordially welcome.</p>

<p>“Phil, unlock the door.&mdash;Everything’s in
order, nice and clean; and be sure you keep it
so, little folks.”</p>

<p>“And mind, darlin’s, it’s the captain that’s
done it all,” put in Phil, as he unlocked the
door. “Niver be ungrateful, for it is a warm
heart has the captain, though he doesn’t always
show it in his face.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Phil, none of that,” cried the
captain, a flash of “ugliness” springing to his
face to give color to Phil’s remark. “Mind your
own business, and open the door.”</p>

<p>“There yez are,” said Phil, throwing open
the door. “In wid yez, and have a raal foine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
frolic afore the schoolmasther comes. Howld on
a bit. Three cheers for yer binefacthor&mdash;Captain
Thompson. Now: one, two, three, and
away you go!”</p>

<p>Phil led off with a cheer, in which the young
people heartily joined. The captain turned down
the hill, followed by Phil and the continued
cheers of the scholars, who, once started, were
not contented with anything short of three times
three, though whether the thought of their
benefactor or the sound of their own voices
contributed more to their enthusiasm, would have
been no hard matter to decide.</p>

<p>The captain, evidently impressed with the
idea that the young Sleepers were to be driven
to school like unruly cattle, was armed with his
whip, and, that there might be no defeat of his
project, had furnished Phil with a stout stick,
and bade him keep a sharp eye on the youngsters
until they were safe in the school-house.
Phil followed meekly, with his weapon under
his arm and a broad grin on his face, for the
comicality of the situation highly delighted the
warm-hearted Hibernian, with whom the young
people were such favorites that, had they meditated
an escape, he would have managed, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
some native blunder, to aid, and not impede, their
attempt.</p>

<p>To the utter astonishment of the captain,
when they reached the house, a transformation
had been accomplished. On a block in the yard
sat Teddy, with a clean face, smoothly-brushed
hair, clothes well patched, to be sure, but without
a rent, and, strangest of all, shoes and
stockings on his feet. Becky sat in the doorway,
with an open book in her lap, hair well
brushed and curled, frock mended, clean apron,
polished shoes, and white stockings. All this
was the work of Hulda Prime. Either in gratitude
to Mrs. Thompson, who had quickly returned
the purloined goodies, with the request that the
children be made presentable, or from a desire
to astonish her enemy, Hulda had risen at an
early hour, aroused the sleepers, washed, brushed,
and mended with an energy that surprised even
the dreamy mother, and, after a lesson in good
behaviour, had set her charge out to dry, until
the arrival of the captain.</p>

<p>Becky had taken the matter very coolly.
When told she was going to school that day,
she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, Teddy and I were going up to the
Basin to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, rafting,” said Teddy. “It’s plaguy
mean to spoil a fellow’s fun.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” replied Becky, with a knowing
nod of the head; “guess we’ll go after school,
any way.”</p>

<p>When thoroughly scoured and adorned, she
took a large book, and sat in the doorway,
where the captain found her.</p>

<p>“Well, young ones, what is it&mdash;peace or
war? Will you go to school quietly, or must
we drive you?” said the captain, when he
had recovered from his surprise.</p>

<p>“You won’t drive us, captain,” said Becky,
looking up, with a smile. “It would be too
hard work. We’re going quietly&mdash;ain’t we,
Teddy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we’re let alone. Ain’t going to be
lugged like a calf to the slaughter-house, any
way,” grumbled Teddy.</p>

<p>“You’d better,” growled the captain. “I
ain’t forgot your capers in my orchard. I’m
just itching to pay off that score. But I’ll call
it square if you give me no trouble now.”</p>

<p>“All right, captain,” replied Becky; “We’ll
go. I’ve been preparing myself for torture in
this blessed book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“What book’s that&mdash;the Bible, hey?” said
the captain.</p>

<p>“It’s ‘Fox’s Book of Martyrs,’ captain; but
I can’t find anything about school in it.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said the captain; “let such books
alone. Come, stir your stumps, or you’ll be
late. Now, recollect, if you give me any trouble&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Thompson, you needn’t be afraid of
them young ones; they won’t eat you!” cried
Aunt Hulda, sticking her head out of the
kitchen doorway. “If you and that big Irish
lubber can’t handle ’em, better call on the committee;
they’ll help you.”</p>

<p>The taunt was so bitter that the captain
raised his whip; but, recollecting the sex of his
opponent, he turned away, with a muttered
“Hang it!” and strode into the road. Teddy
and Becky followed, and Phil brought up the
rear. The march schoolward was devoid of stirring
incidents. Occasionally Becky, annoyed at
the strict guard kept over them, would dart to
the side of the road. The captain and Phil
would run after her, only to find her picking a
flower, or cutting a switch. The captain would
stalk on again, and the captives would exchange<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mischievous glances, while Phil would grow red
in the face with suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>The captain had consumed more time than he
intended in mustering his recruits; and it was
past nine o’clock when he reached the school-house.
His “chicks,” having exhausted their
stock of cheers, had filed into the school-room,
and not averse to Phil’s recommendation, had
indulged in a noisy but good-humored frolic, in
which they were joined by some twenty later
arrivals. They were in the midst of an animated
game of tag, when three distinct raps upon the
teacher’s desk made them aware of the presence
of a stranger. In an instant there was profound
silence in the room, and all eyes were turned
upon the new-comer. He was a young man, of
medium height, broad-shouldered and full-chested,
every movement of his person showing in its
powerful grace the effects of physical culture
and out-door exercise. His face was equally
powerful; piercing black eyes, browned skin,
and a determined lock of the under jaw, showed
a strong will and a daring spirit. Yet an occasional
comical quiver about his eyes, and a lifting
of his slight moustache by a half smile, and
a genial glow of good humor which beamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
through its sternness, as the ruddy cheek glowed
under the brown coating, gave token of the
nobility of power, by its kinship to gentleness
and good humor. To all this were added a high
forehead and an abundance of short, curly locks,
so that the person of the stranger was not only
calculated to command respect, but admiration
as well.</p>

<p>“My young friends,” said he, “I bear a message
from your teacher. He was taken suddenly
ill last Friday night; he is somewhat better this
morning, we think, but unable to be here with
you. He has asked me to take his place, and
wishes you to be patient with one who is a
new hand at keeping school. That’s myself,”
with a smile. “Will you take me?”</p>

<p>“O, yes, sir!” “Yes, sir!” in full chorus.</p>

<p>“Very well. I think we can agree. Take
your places&mdash;boys on the left, girls on the right,
as usual.”</p>

<p>There were three rows of forms on each side,
for the scholars, with a broad open space between;
there was a platform at the farther end, for
recitations; the teacher’s desk faced this, on a
corresponding platform at the left of the door,
and behind his desk was a blackboard affixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to the wall. The room was lighted by three
windows on each side, and one at the farther
end.</p>

<p>The scholars quickly took their places, and
Mr. Drinkwater’s substitute seated himself at
the desk, opened the record book, and commenced
calling the names of the scholars of the
last term in alphabetical order. He was among
the D’s, had reached the name of Hosea Davis,
when the door was thrown open, and Captain
Thompson stalked into the room, followed by
Becky and Teddy.</p>

<p>“Here Drinkwater, here’s a couple of eels
that want training.”</p>

<p>The substitute raised his head quickly.</p>

<p>“Harry Thompson!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Harry Thompson,” said the stranger,
rising. “I hope I see you well, sir.”</p>

<p>The captain did not look well. He turned
pale, and stared at his son as though he could
not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-what does this mean? Why are you
here? Where’s Drinkwater?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Drinkwater is ill, sir; taken suddenly
last Friday. I have been stopping with him for
a few days, and he requested me to open his
school to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s no business to do anything of the kind.
This is my school; and I won’t have it.”</p>

<p>The captain was getting angry.</p>

<p>“I understood him to say that the school-house
was leased to him, and that he was
expected to get a substitute when unable to
attend himself.”</p>

<p>“So he is; but not you, sir, not you. I don’t
want any of your teaching. S’pose you’ll teach
these young ones to disobey their fathers, and
run off. No, sir. You are at liberty. I’ll teach
myself.”</p>

<p>“That is a point you must settle with Mr.
Drinkwater,” said the young man, quietly. “I
have taken command here, and, without meaning
to be disrespectful, propose to hold my position
until relieved by Mr. Drinkwater.”</p>

<p>The captain absolutely foamed with rage.</p>

<p>“You’re an impudent puppy. You’ve no business
here, no business in the place. You’ve
disgraced yourself. After what I’ve done for
you, too!” And the captain went into particulars
as to what he had done, commencing a
long way back in the young man’s history, and
without giving his son a chance to speak, growing
louder and fiercer as his tongue flew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
faster. He was suddenly brought to a stop by
a roar of laughter from the children. He turned
to them in amazement, but not by him was
their merriment caused.</p>

<p>While the captain was giving vent to his
troubles, Miss Becky had stepped upon the platform,
picked up a crayon, and commenced operations
on the blackboard. As she proceeded, all
eyes, with the exception of those belonging to
the captain and his son, were fastened upon
her; and the completion of her picture had
brought forth the interrupting roar.</p>

<p>Becky had one talent which had long been
hid; she had a genius for drawing; but never
before had this peculiar talent been paraded for
public inspection.</p>

<p>But here, as skillfully executed as chalk would
allow, was a drawing representing “Old Uncle
Ned” at full gallop, Becky seated upon his
back, and the captain in full pursuit&mdash;so well
done, that the captain, following the direction
of all eyes, instantly recognized it. Incensed he
made a dart at Becky; but the nimble artist
dodged him, and fled to the farther end of the
room. This produced another roar from the
scholars. The captain checked his pursuit, turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
about, and fled from the room, banging the door
behind him.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson rapped the desk, and commanded
silence.</p>

<p>“Miss Becky Sleeper, remove that drawing
from the blackboard at once,” he said sternly.</p>

<p>Becky looked up at him with a mischievous
smile, which instantly disappeared, as she met
his eye. She meekly obeyed, and the picture
vanished.</p>

<p>“Now, take your place. You, too, Master
Teddy.”</p>

<p>Teddy went over among the boys, and Becky
followed him. Another roar from the scholars.</p>

<p>“Silence!” from the teacher. “Miss Becky,
you will take your place among the girls, where
you belong.”</p>

<p>Becky went the whole length of the room,
scowling at the girls, who had laughed at her
blunder, and took a seat by the window.</p>

<p>Harry concluded his record by affixing the
names of Teddy and Becky, who were the only
new scholars.</p>

<p>“The exercises will be very short this morning,
and there will be but one session. I shall
only call upon you to read; that concluded, you
will be dismissed for the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He then commenced with the boy nearest him,
calling upon them separately to read&mdash;first a
boy, then a girl, in regular succession. They
made their own selections, and with varied success.
There were some good readers, none very
bad, until they reached Teddy. He stepped
upon the platform, and read “Casabianca” somewhat
in this style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote">“‘The boy stood on the&mdash;b-u-r-n-i-n-g&mdash;burning deck,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Whence&mdash;whence&mdash;whence all butim had sled&mdash;no, fled;</div>
<div class="indentbase">The flames that lit the batil wreck</div>
<div class="indentbase">Shine&mdash;shown&mdash;show&mdash;round him o’er the dead;’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which, of course, excited a laugh. It was now
Becky’s turn, and she was called. She did not
move. She could read no better than Teddy,
and she was determined not to be laughed at.</p>

<p>“Becky Sleeper, take the platform!” said the
teacher, in a stern voice.</p>

<p>“I won’t&mdash;there! I didn’t come to school
to you: Mr. Drinkwater’s my teacher.”</p>

<p>Harry Thompson stepped from his desk. The
lower jaw came up with an ominous snap. He
went to where Becky sat kicking the form before
her, and looked down at her. She appeared so
little, that his anger at her sauciness vanished
at once.</p>

<p>“Becky, you and I will have a private session<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
after school. You will read to me then, I think,
for old acquaintance’s sake,” he said, with a
smile, and returned to his desk. “I am very
much obliged to you all for your attention.
School is dismissed. Becky Sleeper will remain.”</p>

<p>There was a rush for out doors, and the
school-room was quickly cleared of all but Becky
and the teacher. Teddy had lingered a moment
to exchange a word with Becky, in which “the
Basin,” and “wait outside,” might be distinguished,
and then had taken his leave.</p>

<p>“Now, Becky, let me hear you read.”</p>

<p>Becky arose, but instead of stepping to the
platform, marched straight for the door. But
not quite fast enough, for Harry stepped before
her, closed the door, and locked it.</p>

<p>“Becky,” said he, “the first duty to be
learned in school is obedience to the teacher.
Go to the platform!”</p>

<p>Becky looked up at him with defiance in her
glance.</p>

<p>“Harry Thompson, you’re just as mean as
you can be. You let those boys and girls laugh
at Teddy and now you want to laugh at me.
I won’t read.”</p>

<p>“Go to the platform.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky turned and went to the platform, and
farther yet; she threw up the window, and
jumped upon the sill, and all very quickly.
Harry saw her intention at once.</p>

<p>“Becky, Becky, don’t do that,” he cried,
running towards her. “It’s ten feet. You’ll
break your neck.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care. I won’t read;” and she leaped.
There was a rustling and tearing among the foliage
beneath the window; but when Harry reached
it, Becky was invisible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">BECKY’S LAST FROLIC.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p090.jpg" width="41" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-T">Teddy Sleeper obeyed Becky’s injunction
to wait outside, by passing round
school-house, and down the hill,
to the window at the end, that he might be in
readiness should she desire to signal him during
her confinement. He was just in time to witness
her descent. She plumped into a cluster
of bushes, and for a moment was lost to sight.
Even this terrific leap did not surprise the
phlegmatic Teddy, who had such an exalted
opinion of his sister’s prowess, that, had she
jumped from the steeple of the church, he
would have expected her to pick herself up as
coolly as she did now, emerging from the bushes
with ruffled plumage, but without a scratch or
bruise.</p>

<p>“Well, Becky, got out sooner than I thought
you would. Did he make you read?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” replied Becky, with a sneer.
“It will take a smarter teacher than him to
make me do what I don’t want to. He’s nothing
but a boy.”</p>

<p>“What will the captain say now, Becky?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what he says. Guess he don’t
like the teacher any better than I do. Come,
let’s get away from here; he’ll be after us.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Where we were going this morning. We’ve
got time to ‘shoot the Basin’ before dinner.”</p>

<p>So saying, Becky, whose hasty exit from the
school-room had not allowed her to gain possession
of her hat, started off bareheaded, followed
by Teddy, along the bank of the river, towards
the Corner.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson inherited a streak of the
obstinacy which was so apparent in his father.
As Becky disappeared from one side of the window,
he rushed from the other, caught up his
hat, unlocked the door, and hastened down the
hill, only to see his unruly pupil climbing a
fence twenty rods away. This convinced him
that no bones had been broken. But he was
not inclined to let the matter drop here; so he
returned to the school-room, made all secure,
and then started in pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>As he moved along the bank of the river, the
leading event of the morning was uppermost in
his thoughts. The appearance of his father in
the school-room had not been unexpected, and
the explanation he had given of his own presence
there was perfectly true. Mr. Drinkwater
was ill, and had sent him as a substitute. Harry,
who was well acquainted with the new school-house
affair, had, after consultation with his
mother, who visited him daily at Mr. Drinkwater’s
residence, where he was domiciled for
the express purpose of meeting her, accepted
the position that he might try the temper of his
father, and pave the way to a reconciliation, if
that were possible. He was quietly awaiting
the conclusion of the captain’s vehement review
of “what he had done for him,” when he
expected to have an opportunity to say a word
in his own defence; but Miss Becky’s exhibition
of <em>chalkotype</em> art interrupted the contemplated
plea, and sadly disarranged his plans.
His only consolation was, that Mr. Drinkwater
would not be able to take charge of the school
for several days, and another meeting might be
possible.</p>

<p>Becky, in her turn, occupied a share of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
thoughtful attention. He had looked forward
with pleasure to the meeting with his little
playmate, fully expecting that the years which
had wrought so much change in his character,
would have shaped the little maid, of whom he
was so fond,&mdash;with her quick wit and active
spirit,&mdash;into something better than the hoiden
he found her. Her saucy movements, her rough
appearance, and her rudeness, had startled him;
but, remembering the influences by which she
was surrounded at home, and the artistic
touch displayed at the blackboard, he was convinced
that in that little body were capabilities
running to waste, which, trained aright, might
blossom into usefulness. If his good mother only
had the trailing of this wild vine, it would flourish
in fruitfulness, and not cumber the ground. It
was not yet too late. He would take his mother
into his confidence.</p>

<p>Full of thoughts like these, Harry went on,
keeping a sharp lookout for the runaway, until
he reached the paper-mill at the Corner. Here
he was informed that the young Sleepers had
gone farther up the river’s bank. Undecided
whether to go on or retrace his steps, he passed
into the mill, and, meeting his old friend, Mark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Small, went over the building with him, viewing
the improvements, in which he became so much
interested that he quite forgot the object of his
expedition.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Becky and Teddy had,
after a long tramp, and with no small vaulting
of fences and climbing of rocks, reached the
Basin.</p>

<p>Rogue’s River, the base of Becky’s future
operations, was dammed at three points. The
lower dam was at the fore side, the middle dam
just above the school-house, and the upper dam
at the Corner. Here was located Small’s paper-mill,
not a very extensive affair, but which
employed a dozen men and as many girls. In
the middle of the river, about a quarter of a
mile above this mill, was a small island, scarcely
twenty feet in circumference, on which flourished
a wild growth of unproductive bushes, with
one solitary sentinel of a tree in their centre;
and above this was the Basin. Into this basin,
after a winding flow of ten or twelve miles,
increased by several minor streams, the water
poured with considerable power. It lay in the
form of a heart, so often depicted on valentines,
or moulded in sugar for the sweet-toothed. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was about thirty feet from bank to bank, and
about the same distance from the point of
entrance to the island, which shooting into it,
gave it a resemblance to the emblem of affection.
Divided by this island, the water swept along
on either side in strong, swift currents. When
Harry Thompson, as leader of the boys of Cleverly,
had exhausted all the known means of
amusement, his daring spirit suggested a difficult
feat, calculated to carry dismay to the
hearts of his followers, and cause uneasiness to
those parents who had an interest in the safety
of their children. He not only suggested it,
but himself performed it, and succeeded in inducing
a few of the boldest to follow his example.
This feat was known as “shooting the Basin.”
Into the winding river he launched a log, of
which there were many lying along the banks,
a mill hand being employed at this point to
draw them out of the stream. Upon this he
stepped, with a long, narrow strip of board to
serve as a rudder, with which to guide his craft.
The force of the stream swiftly carried him into
the Basin and towards the island. It was only
necessary to keep “her head” straight, and the
island was reached.</p>

<p>He accomplished the feat, well knowing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
danger he incurred; for, had his craft swerved
either to the right or left, he would have been
capsized or carried down the river. Of course
there could be no returning in the same manner.
But, to prevent his becoming a Robinson
Crusoe, a tree on the bank was felled so as to
bridge the stream from the bank to the island;
and there it had remained ever since.</p>

<p>Becky Sleeper, having seen Harry perform
this feat, had desired to undertake it; but Harry
had strongly objected, and the tomboy, having
accepted him as a leader, was obliged to postpone
the attempt.</p>

<p>Some recent conversations on old sports between
Teddy and herself had awakened a desire to
attempt this feat, and a trip to the Basin had
already been arranged for Monday, when the
school programme was promulgated.</p>

<p>The short session, and Becky’s escape, had
made the old arrangement possible; and the
young Amazon and her faithful squire were now
on the banks of the upper stream, after a quick
march, ready to launch their barks upon the
tide, careless of consequences.</p>

<p>“Now, Teddy,” said Becky, “I’ll go first:
you must watch me closely, and do just as I do.
You ain’t scared&mdash;are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Teddy, to tell the truth, was looking rather
anxiously at the rushing stream, the broad basin,
and the two foaming channels beyond. The
stream had been swollen by heavy rains, and
the feat seemed more difficult than he had imagined
before he set out.</p>

<p>“N-o, of course not,” he said slowly. “If
you go, I’m bound to anyway.”</p>

<p>“Because, if you are Teddy, you’d better not
try it.”</p>

<p>“I will try, Becky. I ain’t a goin’ to be
stumped by a girl.”</p>

<p>“All right. But don’t you start until I reach
the island; and be sure you keep your log
pointed right straight at the tree.”</p>

<p>While speaking, Becky had rolled a short,
stout log into the water, picked up a light slab,
and was ready for the dash. Stepping lightly
and quickly upon the log, she pushed it into
the middle of the stream, headed it for the tree,
and, carefully guiding her craft, shot across the
Basin, and struck the island fairly and squarely.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! I’ve done it Teddy!” she shouted,
as she leaped upon the land.</p>

<p>“All right; I’m a comin’. Hooray!” answered
Teddy, as he jumped upon his log, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
darted down the stream, Teddy dancing rather
lively to regain his equilibrium, which had sustained
a shock by the sudden dart of his log.
He was so busily engaged in this manœuvre
that he failed to head his bark as he should,
and, instead of going straight across the Basin,
he swept to the right.</p>

<p>“Teddy, Teddy, what are you about?” shouted
Becky. “Turn her head! quick, quick!”</p>

<p>But Teddy was frightened; his log was rolling
over and over, and he dropped his rudder,
fell upon the log, and clasped it, with his legs
in the water, and round into the swifter of the
two currents it went, very near the island.
Seeing his danger, Becky ran to the edge of
the island, and attempted to rescue him. She
leaned far over, lost her balance, and fell into
the stream. Bungling Teddy clutched the bushes
as he passed, let the log go, and pulled himself
to land; but Becky was swept past the island,
and went floating down the river.</p>

<p>Teddy, seeing the danger of his sister, shouted
lustily for help. Two men, at work near the
bank, ran down to the water, saw the struggling
girl, but could afford no assistance; but they
started off at a swift pace for the mill. Becky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was an excellent swimmer; she was not a bit
frightened, but struck out bravely in a vain
attempt to reach the bank. The stream was
strong and swift, and bore her on faster and
faster towards the dam. Skillfully she kept her
head above water, and struck out to reach
Teddy’s log, which was just ahead of her. Fast
as she went, the men on the shore flew faster
still. It was a case of life and death. They
reached the mill.</p>

<p>“Help, help! there’s a girl in the water!”</p>

<p>Men came running out, women ran to the
windows; there was wild commotion, but no
attempt at rescue.</p>

<p>“We can’t help her; she must go over the
dam!”</p>

<p>“Throw her a rope&mdash;it’s her only chance!”</p>

<p>“Mighty slim chance: she’s too much frightened
to catch it. She can’t be saved!”</p>

<p>“She can be saved! Quick! a long, stout
rope!”</p>

<p>It was a commanding voice that spoke, a commanding
form that stepped forward&mdash;the school-master,
Harry Thompson. Quickly a rope was
placed in his hand.</p>

<p>“Now, three good, strong fellows, follow me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>He threw off his coat, ran along the bank,
winding the rope around his body, and tying it
as he ran. Becky was coming down swiftly,
when the roar of the dam reached her ears.
For the first time she felt her danger. Instantly
all power of exertion forsook her. The terrible
dam! the jagged rocks beneath! There was
death in the thought, and a shrill scream rang
over the water.</p>

<p>“Help, help! Don’t let me drown! don’t let
me go over the dam!”</p>

<p>“Courage, Becky, courage. You shall be
saved.”</p>

<p>She recognized the voice, even in her agony.
“O, Harry, Harry! save me, save me!”</p>

<p>Still on and on she swept, and the roar of
the dam grew louder and louder. It seemed to
sound in her ears like thunder.</p>

<p>“Now, quick, boys, quick! Give me plenty
of rope, and hold on strong!”</p>

<p>Harry Thompson kicked off his shoes and
threw away his hat. Becky was moving towards
him, but ten feet from the bank. He measured
the distance with his eye, stepped back a few
paces, then ran quickly, and leaped into the
water. The best jumper in the county had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
well calculated his distance. He struck the
water close beside Becky. He clasped her quick,
she threw her arms about his neck with a scream
of joy, and both sank beneath the water.</p>

<p>Then the good, strong fellows pulled with a
will, and in a moment Becky and her preserver
were safe on the bank. Such a shout as the
good fellows sent up, then such a chorus of
shouts as the people at the mill joined to theirs,
was never before heard in Cleverly.</p>

<p>But the chorus of rejoicing was unheard by
Becky, who lay upon the bank insensible. The
girls from the mill gathered about her, rubbed
her hands, bathed her temples, and used all the
customary means of restoration; but yet she lay
there cold and still.</p>

<p>Harry became alarmed. She must be taken
home at once.</p>

<p>“Small, bring your wagon&mdash;quick! Send a
man for the doctor&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>Small’s team was standing at the mill door.
In a few moments Harry was in the wagon,
with Becky in his arms, and one of the “good
fellows” was racing down the road, horseback,
for the doctor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sleeper, weak and dispirited, was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
kitchen, standing at the table, washing the dinner
dishes; Aunt Hulda, nursing an attack of
lumbago, was groaning at the fireside. A wagon
drove swiftly into the yard, a moment, and
Harry Thompson stood in the doorway, bearing
the insensible form of Becky.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sleeper, quick! your camphor bottle!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sleeper dropped the dish in her hands;
her eyes glared at the helpless girl. Her lips
parted, but no sound came from them. Then
her eyes closed, her hands clutched the air, and
she fell heavily to the floor. Aunt Hulda ran
to her and raised her head.</p>

<p>“Delia Sleeper, what on airth ails you?&mdash;Here,
you, Henry Thompson, take that girl into
the settin’ room. That’s just like you Thompsons&mdash;always
a scarin’ folks to death.&mdash;Delia,
Delia! what ails you?”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda rubbed her, and sprinkled water
over her, scolding all the while. Harry carried
Becky to the sitting-room, and laid her upon the
lounge. As he did so, a sigh, and the opening
of her eyes, gave assurance of returning animation;
and when, in a few minutes, Dr. Allen
entered, there was no occasion for his services,
for Becky was sitting up, and inquiring for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Teddy, who at that moment was coming down
the road, between the mill and the school-house,
feeling very wet and mean.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sleeper was carried to her room, and
laid upon the bed. Dr. Allen, finding Becky so
comfortable, made the former a visit.</p>

<p>“Doctor, what ails her? Is it stericks?”</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>“Worse than that, worse than that!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! Goodness gracious! it’s
purrellysis.”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. Aunt Hulda was right.
The sudden shock, upon the long and weary
straining for the ever-distant ship, had snapped
the cords of action, and left her powerless.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">MRS. THOMPSON DISOBEYS ORDERS.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p104.jpg" width="67" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-W-quote">“When that grim smith, Adversity,
stalks unannounced and unwelcome
into the abode, erects his forge,
bares his strong arm, and sets himself to work
among our affections, feeding his fire with
earthly treasures, perhaps too fondly prized; or
poisoning the air with unhealthy vapors, that
blight with disease; or shaping upon his anvil
the arrows of death, for instant use among the
loved ones,&mdash;it is a hard task to meet him hospitably;
to be patient under the agony of his
blows; to realize, in his presence, that in his
forge is the soul whitened and made pliable, that
under the heavy hammer he relentlessly wields
it is shaped to nearness of perfection.</p>

<p>“But when time has cooled the beaten soul,
then it realizes how much stronger it has grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
through that dread experience; how much better
fitted it is to meet the ever-returning guest;
then it recognizes in this hard-hitting smith,
Adversity, an earnest worker for the universal
good.”</p>

<p>Thus preached Parson Arnold, the salaried
fountain from which the good people of Cleverly
drew the living waters for their spiritual needs.
His auditors were Captain Thompson and his
good wife, to whom the parson had just communicated
the misfortunes of the Sleeper family,
on the day of their occurrence, he having picked
up the intelligence at the blacksmith’s shop,
while awaiting the setting of a tooth into an
iron rake, upon which he was now leaning in
the sitting-room at Captain Thompson’s. Perhaps
the skill of the agricultural dentist had
suggested the illustration with which he seasoned
his short discourse upon the uses of adversity,
for he was an earnest worker both in his Master’s
vineyard and his own, and used both logical
and local arguments to drive home to the hearts
of his people the great truth which he
honestly believed.</p>

<p>“Poor soul! struck down in an instant! what
will become of the children?” said Mrs. Thompson.</p>

<p>“The town will have to take care of ’em.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
After this caper I’ve done with ’em. I wash
my hands of all responsibility,” growled the
captain. “That young tomboy of theirn has
kicked about until she’s broke her mother’s
heart; and I hope she’ll have to suffer for it.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, brother; we must be charitable.
Remember her youth and inexperience,” the
parson mildly remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t likely to forget it. It’s been
a dear experience to me; and I won’t have
anything more to do with them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Paul,” said Mrs. Thompson,
rising from her chair. “They need kindness more
than ever. Their poor mother can no longer
guide them: shall we desert them now?”</p>

<p>“Guide them! Stuff! She never did guide
them. If she had, she’d have been saved all
this trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, they’re in the Lord’s hands,” said
the parson; “in his hands who suffers not a
sparrow to fall to the ground without his notice.
Leave all to him.”</p>

<p>The parson put on his hat, shouldered his
rake, and departed. Mrs. Thompson attended
him to the door, returned, folded up her work,
and left the room. The captain followed her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
motions with his eyes. Something was wrong.
There was no <em>heart</em> in his obstinacy. He evidently
felt ill at ease. He walked about the
room rapidly, as though endeavoring to rouse
up something like an angry spirit; but the fire
would not kindle. Instead of the angry flash
which should have shone in his eye, there was
a tear, and the muscles of his mouth quivered
with suppressed emotion. Mrs. Thompson entered
the room, equipped in bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>“What! going out again, Rebecca?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Paul; I am going at once.” Mrs.
Thompson looked almost defiantly at her husband,
expecting the next question, and fully
prepared to answer it. But the second question
was indefinitely postponed. It trembled on the
captain’s lips, but something in his wife’s face
told him if he asked it his power to rule was
gone forever.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be gone long; it’s lonesome here
without you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson seemed in turn disappointed,
but she said nothing, and departed. The captain
took a seat upon the sofa, whence he had
a view of the road, and deliberately watched
his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum! told you so,” soliloquized he; “there
she goes&mdash;straight down the hill! There never
was such a woman! Deliberately disobeying
her husband. Bless her good heart! I knew
she’d go. Never could stand that&mdash;never! It’s
wrong. Obedience is a wife’s first duty. Won’t
she make things fly over there! Poor Delia!
She shan’t want for physic as long as I live;
and those young ones&mdash;well, well, boys will be
boys, and girls will be&mdash;tomboys, sometimes, I
suppose. There she goes, up the hill, now.
Disobedience,&mdash;rank disobedience! I can’t endure
the sight of it, and I won’t! I’ll just saddle
Uncle Ned, and go and see the doctor. She
must have constant attendance; and my wife,&mdash;no,
I won’t forgive her disobedience&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>The captain now went to the window, and
watched until his wife turned into the gate;
then, heaving a sigh (more closely resembling
satisfaction than regret), went in pursuit of
Phil and Uncle Ned.</p>

<p>Lightning, that swift agent of destruction,
has been known, in the midst of its vagaries, to
smite gigantic rocks, and lay open veins of
wealth never before discovered. When the bolt
of misfortune struck the Sleeper house, it brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to light a much-needed treasure in the person
of the forlorn, complaining Aunt Hulda. She
seemed electrified by the stroke that paralyzed
the languid mother, and all the powers of her
being sprang into active life. All the theoretical
knowledge she had acquired by her long, useless
“helping” of other people, burst into fruitful
bloom. From the moment Mrs. Sleeper was
laid upon her bed, she was the careful, watchful
nurse, quietly but hurriedly arranging everything
for the comfort of the invalid, laying her plans
for a long fit of sickness with all the skill of
an old campaigner. Nor did her usefulness end
here. From the chamber to the kitchen she
flew, washed and put away the dishes, replenished
the fire, swept and tidied up the kitchen,
re-filled the kettle, made up a batch of bread
and set it “rising,” and back again to the bed-side
of her patient, without one thought of her
own magazine of combustible troubles ready to
explode at a spark of complaint. All this with
a feverish uneasiness, as though she feared the
coming of somebody to take the power to do
out of her hands. A gentle knock at the door
of the sick chamber, and the entrance of Mrs.
Thompson, told her the somebody she feared
had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson gave her hand to Aunt Hulda
with a quiet smile, and went to the bed. What
there was left of life in the body of Delia
Sleeper seemed concentrated in her face. She
could not move foot or hand; but the same
watchful glance was in her eyes, and the shadow
of a smile played about her mouth, as her old
friend bent over her and kissed her.</p>

<p>“So kind! so good! I knew you’d come.”</p>

<p>Faint and tremulous was the voice of the
invalid.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear heart; I’ve come to nurse you, to
make you strong and well again.”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda groaned. Her power was slipping
from her.</p>

<p>“No, no. Aunt Hulda&mdash;so kind&mdash;she does
everything. She will nurse me&mdash;thank you.
Let me&mdash;see you often&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>The eyes wandered to Aunt Hulda with a
beseeching look that Mrs. Thompson divined at
once.</p>

<p>“Bless you child! I’ll not interfere with her.
She shall be mistress in the house; and a good
one she’ll make.”</p>

<p>This was said with a smile for Aunt Hulda
that warmed the heart of the spinster towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the visitor. There was a pleased look in the
eyes of the invalid, as those of Mrs. Thompson
came back to her full of love and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Come closer. Becky&mdash;my
Becky&mdash;don’t let her believe she did this. I’ve
brought it on myself&mdash;the doctor said so. Too
much watching&mdash;you know&mdash;it’s been wearing
upon me. The ship&mdash;that never comes&mdash;never,
never comes. But it will&mdash;I know it will.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t speak of that, Delia, now. The
ship will come in God’s good time,” said Mrs.
Thompson. “Remember the dear ones here,
and trust the absent one to his care.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but I didn’t,” said the sick one,
sighing. “I forgot my treasures here, hoping
to clasp that other every day; and now I’m
punished. Wasted life! Wasted life! Poor
little girl! with her mother’s heart shut against
her, drifting away&mdash;running to waste; and so
smart and apt to learn! God pity me! God
pity me!”</p>

<p>“Leave all to me, Delia. Let no thought of
Becky disturb you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot help it. It seems to me as though
I had wilfully neglected her.”</p>

<p>“Not as I have, Delia. With all your household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
cares, my little namesake claimed some
portion of my attention; and we have not met
for years. Delia, you know the reason. I
blame myself for this long neglect.”</p>

<p>“No, no; you were always a kind, good friend.
But I suppose he thought it best. Becky is in
the sitting-room; won’t you see her and comfort
her?”</p>

<p>“Now and always. With Aunt Hulda’s permission,
she shall be my especial charge hereafter.”</p>

<p>“O, you are so good! No wonder people
love you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson kissed her friend, and passed
out of the room. Aunt Hulda smoothed the bedclothes,
and looked at her patient inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, go, go,” said Mrs. Sleeper. “But first
kiss me, Aunt Hulda&mdash;won’t you my best
friend?”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda made a dash at her lips, and a
loud smack resounded through the room.</p>

<p>“You dear, dear, dear child! May the Lord
give me strength to do for you as you deserve!”</p>

<p>With her apron to her eyes, Aunt Hulda left
the room, leaving the invalid to her solitary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
vigil. Already was adversity working in her
for good. The mother-love so long repressed in
her heart had, by one of those strange phases
of illness, at once asserted itself the ruling
power. Only a few hours had the active forces
refused to obey the will; only a few hours had
the brain caught this new power from the heart;
yet it had travelled over years and years of
neglect and wasted opportunity, with bitter regrets
that might yet shape themselves into
guiding forces, in the lonely vigils of the years
to come.</p>

<p>Becky Sleeper, under the shadow of this sudden
visitation, had in turn received a shock.
The terrible sequel to her frolic had, upon her
revival, produced such a nervous state, that for
two hours she lay upon the sofa, trembling and
weeping, in the presence of the astonished
Teddy, who never before had seen a tear in
the eyes of his volatile sister. Harry Thompson
had, when he found her in no danger, consulted
his own safety by driving to the house of Mr.
Drinkwater for a change of raiment. Aunt
Hulda’s attention was required at the bed-side
of her patient, and Miss Becky was left to recover
at her leisure. The period of lamentation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
having passed away, she lapsed into a state of
dejection, so long and silent that Teddy, weary
with waiting for her to break the silence, quietly
fell asleep.</p>

<p>Becky’s thoughts ran over and over the recent
events; but in the midst of them all this was
uppermost: “I’ve killed mother.” Again she
swept across the Basin; again clutched at drifting
Teddy; again fell splashing in the water;
again glided down the stream, heard the roar
of the dam, the voice of Harry; but all mixed
with this one thought, “I’ve killed mother.”
And she buried her head in the sofa, shut her
eyes hard, and thrust her fingers into her ears,
in vain attempts to shut out the thought. What
would become of her? Would she be locked
up in jail&mdash;hanged? She must be, for it was
murder!</p>

<p>Becky was not well skilled in reasoning. She
could not have told why this feeling took
possession of her; but there was a dim consciousness
that she must be an awful wicked girl, and
that it was somebody’s duty to punish her for
this, and a wild wish that somebody would be
quick about it, and have it all over with. In
this state she was conscious of the opening of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the door, and the presence of some one in the
room. There was a light step by her side; a
soft hand was placed upon her head.</p>

<p>“Becky, my child, you are making yourself
miserable.”</p>

<p>Becky knew that well enough. Why should
she be told what she knew so well? It was
nobody’s business, any way. Why didn’t people
attend to their own affairs? She failed to recognize
the voice, and, being in an ugly state
of misery, snatched the soft hand from its resting-place,
and flung it rudely from her, with
her eyes defiantly closed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson did not replace the hand, did
not repeat the words. She stood looking at
the girl a moment, then passed across the room,
and took a seat by the window. This movement
set Becky to thinking. Who could it be?
It was a kind voice, a warm, soft hand. There
was no feeling of punishment in either. Why
didn’t the visitor speak again? How rude she
had been! Then there came a long pause. She
was listening intently for some signs of her
visitor’s presence. Hush! No; that was Teddy,
snoring. She recognized that; and then&mdash;yes,
some one was breathing by the window. Who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
could it be? Some one quietly waiting for her
to get over her ugly fit. She felt a pair of
eyes were fastened upon her. Wondered if her
hair was fit to be seen, if there were any rents
in her dress, and&mdash;and&mdash;O, dear, this was
terrible! She would know the worst.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang up, and looking across the
room, met the loving eyes of Mrs. Thompson;
saw a smile wreathing about the lips; saw the
arms of the good woman stretched out to her
so invitingly, that, without further invitation,
she ran into them, and nestled her head among
the plaits of Mrs. Thompson’s merino, as if she
had an undoubted right there. Then of course,
she fell to crying again.</p>

<p>“O, Aunt Rebecca! you’re so good! and I’m
so wicked!”</p>

<p>“No, no, pet. I’m a wicked woman for
neglecting you so long. But it’s all right now.
I have you in my arms, just as I had you when
you were a baby; and I don’t mean to let you
go. Now tell me what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know? I’ve killed my
mother!”</p>

<p>“No, no, pet. Dismiss that fear from your
mind. She is very ill; perhaps may never recover;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
but the doctor says her disease has been
a long time coming on.”</p>

<p>“And that I tumbled into the water, got
most drowned, and frightened the life out of
her,” burst out Becky. “O dear, dear! what
will become of me?” And another deluge of
tears swept over the placid bosom of Mrs.
Thompson.</p>

<p>“Hush, hush, dear child! You were not to
blame. Any sudden shock might have caused
the disaster.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Rebecca, do you mean to say I am
not a bad, wicked girl?”</p>

<p>Becky straightened up with such an air of
<em>injured guilt</em> that Mrs. Thompson looked at her
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Becky, how old are you?”</p>

<p>“Sixteen, Aunt Rebecca.”</p>

<p>“Quite a young lady, I declare. Now that
mother is laid upon a sick bed, the care of the
house devolves upon you. Girls of sixteen are
usually fitted for that position. Do you feel
prepared to attend to those duties?”</p>

<p>Becky hung her head.</p>

<p>“No, Becky, you are not a wicked girl. But
it is time for some good friend to show you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
how you have wasted the powers God has given
you. Had you given the same attention to
learning to keep house that you have to playing
ball and tag, to robbing orchards and shooting
the Basin, you would have been ready to take
your place at your mother’s bed-side, or to take
charge of cooking. You would have gained the
good opinion of everybody, instead of being
shunned as a tomboy; and you would not then
have reproached yourself, as you do now, for
being the cause of your mother’s illness.”</p>

<p>“I know it, I know; ’tis all my fault, ’tis
all my fault!” sobbed Becky.</p>

<p>“Not altogether your fault, pet. You have
had no one to lead you aright. But ’tis time you
learned a young woman’s duties. You are quick,
intelligent, apt to learn. Will you let me give
you a few lessons, Becky?”</p>

<p>“O, Aunt Rebecca, if you don’t hate me, if
you will try and make something of me, I’ll
never go out doors again as long as I live!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson smiled.</p>

<p>“Plants will not thrive without air, Becky:
you shall have plenty of it. Now, dry your
eyes, and come with me to see mother.”</p>

<p>“Not now, Aunt Rebecca; I’m not fit. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hope you’ll make something of me; but it’s an
awful bad job. One thing I mean to do. I’ll try
just as hard as ever I can to do just what you
tell me.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Miss Becky Sleeper; and if
you do what that angel woman tells you, you
are on the straight road to heaven, I can tell
you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harry Thompson came running into the
room.</p>

<p>“Don’t scold, mother. I’ve been listening
outside the door for the last five minutes. Let
me congratulate you on your promising pupil.”</p>

<p>“I think I can make something of her,” said
Mrs. Thompson looking with pride at her
handsome son.</p>

<p>“Not without my help, mother. I know all
the good points of that sportive genius, for,
alas! I helped to train them in the wrong way.
So, to make amends, employ me in the good
work of training this wandering vine in the
proper direction. What do you say, Miss
Becky?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, Harry,” said
Becky, soberly. “Is it some new game you
want to teach me? If it is, I can’t learn it,
for I’ve promised not to play any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, Becky, ’tis a new game. We’ll call
it ‘Excelsior,’ a game which requires work, and
not play.”</p>

<p>“Don’t puzzle the child, Harry,” said Mrs.
Thompson.</p>

<p>“Child!” echoed Harry. “Sweet sixteen;
and yet she’s but a child.”</p>

<p>“You saved my life, Harry,” said Becky,
with tears in her eyes. “I don’t know as I
ought to thank you for doing it, for Aunt Rebecca
says it’s been a wasted life. But I do
thank you all the same.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ve brought you into a new life,
Becky. I hope I have&mdash;the life of usefulness
we all should live.”</p>

<p>“Look out, Becky! she’s drifting!” shouted
Teddy, in his sleep. “She’s drifting! she
drifting!”</p>

<p>He moved uneasily in his sleep, started, rolled
off his chair, and <em>drifted</em> on to the floor, with a
crash that shook the house.</p>

<p>“Teddy Sleeper, what ails you? Wake up!”
cried Becky, running to him, and shaking him.
“Don’t you see we’ve got company?”</p>

<p>Teddy rolled over, sat up, and stared wildly
about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care, Becky Sleeper. I ain’t a goin’
to be stumped by a girl, any way.”</p>

<p>Harry Thompson laughed so loud that Teddy
sprang to his feet in confusion.</p>

<p>“Stick to that, Teddy, and we’ll make a man
of you.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">BECKY’S NEW BIRTH.</span></h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi-I">Into the life thus accidentally opened to
her, Becky dashed with the same vigor
and determination which had characterized
her dealings with the sports of tomboyhood.</p>

<p>On the departure of the Thompsons, she
marched into the kitchen, and surprised Aunt
Hulda by pulling the table into the middle of
the floor, spreading the cloth, and arranging the
dishes for supper.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, child! What’s come to
you?” cried the spinster, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word, Aunt Hulda. I’ve been a
bad girl, but I mean to do better. I’m not going
to let you do all the work in this house.”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda looked at the girl uneasily. Was
this madcap endeavoring to take the reins out
of her hands?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed! Praps you’d like to be mistress,
and order me round.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Aunt Hulda; you shall be mistress,
and I’ll be maid. It’s little I know,
shame on me! but I want to learn; and you
know how to teach so well that I shan’t bother
you long with my clumsiness, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s clever. You’re real handy, too;
only you’ve put the knives and forks on the
wrong side of the plates.”</p>

<p>“So I have,” said Becky, quickly “changing
sides.” “Where are you going now, Aunt
Hulda?”</p>

<p>“After wood; the fire’s getting low. It’s got
to be chopped, too. But I can manage that.”</p>

<p>“No, you must not.&mdash;Here, Teddy, bring in
a good big armful of wood; and don’t you never
let Aunt Hulda bring another stick.”</p>

<p>Teddy had been standing by the window,
gazing, in open-mouthed astonishment, at Becky’s
proceedings. He roused himself at her sharp
call, and obeyed.</p>

<p>“Guess Becky’s a little out of head,” he
soliloquized, in the woodshed. “Got too much
water on the brain in the dam.”</p>

<p>Supper finished, Becky washed the dishes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
cleared away, and swept the kitchen, under the
direction of Aunt Hulda, and then insisted on
making bread, after careful directions from the
mistress. All this was faithfully reported to
Mrs. Sleeper by Aunt Hulda.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Delia, there’s the making of a
smart woman in that girl; and it’s coming out
fast.”</p>

<p>When bed time came, Becky went in to her
mother with a sad face. The idea that she had
caused her mother’s illness was so strong upon
her, that it could not be easily dissipated. Perhaps
it was better so, if it only strengthened her
in her determination to achieve success in the
new life.</p>

<p>“How do you feel to-night, mother?” said
Becky choking down a sob, and laying her
hand on her mother’s head, with a caress.</p>

<p>“Happy, Becky, very happy,” said the mother,
with a smile. “The light step of a little woman
about the house has made me wonderfully contented.”</p>

<p>The “little woman” blushed, then said, with
a smile she found it hard to muster,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sick people should not listen. But I’m glad
it made you happy, mother. Shall I stay with
you to-night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; Aunt Hulda will take care of me.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, mother” with a kiss. “Don’t
worry about me. I mean to try, O, so hard&mdash;”</p>

<p>She could say no more. The tears would
come, spite of her efforts to repress them; and
she ran from the room.</p>

<p>She slept little that night; the new tenant&mdash;thought&mdash;rambled
strangely about in its unfamiliar
quarters, as if uncertain at what task to
set itself, in what corner of this little head to
find a resting-place.</p>

<p>Mr. Drinkwater was no better the next morning,
and Harry Thompson opened the school, as
usual. He was gratified, on casting his eyes
about the room, to see Becky and Teddy in
the places assigned them the day before; and
very much surprised, when the religious exercises
were concluded, to see Becky rise from her
place, and march to the centre of the room.</p>

<p>“Master Thompson, if you please, I was very
rude to you yesterday. I want to beg your pardon
before all the scholars.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Becky; you were somewhat
rude; but this free confession amply atones for
it. You are forgiven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want all the scholars to know, if you please,
that after school, when I was told to take my
place upon the platform, I jumped out of the
window.”</p>

<p>Harry bit his lip. This was just what he didn’t
want the scholars to know; and they never would
have known how he had been outwitted, but
for Becky’s confession. She was altogether too
penitent.</p>

<p>“That will do, Miss Becky. You have said
quite enough. I shall expect better conduct from
you in the future.”</p>

<p>“I mean to try, sir.”</p>

<p>Becky returned to her seat. She did try hard
that day; and not only that day, but every day,
found her trying, and succeeding, too. She diligently
applied herself to the studies assigned
her, watched her conduct carefully, and in a very
short time Harry Thompson had reason to be
proud of his pupil. She gave Teddy a helping
hand, also. She was pained to hear the laugh
when Teddy blundered; so every night at home
Teddy was carefully tutored by his sister for
the next day’s task; and in a short time he, too,
accomplished wonders.</p>

<p>As soon as the brain was trained to systematized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
labor, Becky’s sharp eyes traced the difference
in her attire and that of the girls about
her; and very soon improvement was noticed in
this. Mrs. Thompson, whose visits to the brown
house were now of daily occurrence, taught her
to sew. Material was readily found among the
stock of presents the sailor husband had been
accustomed to bring his wife, and which had
never been made up; and thus Becky was as
neat and well dressed a girl as there was in the
school. She made quick progress with her studies.
In one branch she excelled all&mdash;that of drawing.
Harry had introduced this as a pleasant study,
with no idea that Becky had such a genius for
it as she rapidly displayed.</p>

<p>Mr. Drinkwater continued ill all the winter,
and Harry kept the school, by his orders; for,
contrary to his expectations, Captain Thompson
did not come into the school. The shrewd proprietor
evidently discovered the trick to bring
about a reconciliation, and, with his usual obstinacy,
defeated the well laid plan. And so,
autumn gave place to winter, and the snow lay
heavily on the ground. Winter, in turn, gave
place to spring, with all its opening beauties;
and school was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry Thompson stood upon the steps of the
school-house, the door locked behind him for
the last time, the key in his hand. His scholars
had gone; up and down the road he could hear
their merry voices, as they wended their ways
homeward. But one was left to keep him company&mdash;Becky
Sleeper. She stood beside him,
anxiously watching his troubled face; for the
master was looking across the road at the home
of his childhood, where he could not now enter.
He was bitterly disappointed in his labors; they
had not brought about the reconciliation for
which he had plotted, and which, for his mother’s
sake, he had so longed for. He turned, with a
sigh, to Becky.</p>

<p>“Well, little one, school is over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry. It’s been a pleasant time for
me. How can I thank you for having been so
kind to me, for having taught me so much, and
being such a dear, kind friend?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been able to do you some good,
Becky. My labor has not been fruitless, after
all.”</p>

<p>Fruitless! No. One look at the thoughtful
face beside him, one glance at the trim figure,
might convince him of that. Six months ago a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hoiden, to-day a woman; bright, young, beautiful,
still; but strong, energetic, persevering, rapidly
unfolding the intellectual graces of true
womanhood.</p>

<p>He was fond of his pupil; and to her he was
a hero&mdash;always had been; but for the last six
months they had been constantly in each other’s
company. Out of school, many of the old familiar
ways had been revived. They had ridden,
sailed, rowed, even indulged in an occasional
game of cricket. At her home he was a constant
visitor, that being the established rendezvous
for meeting his mother; and mother and
son had diligently wrought&mdash;quietly, but earnestly&mdash;a
great change in her life. She knew it, and
blessed them for it. These two were very dear
to each other, and, without knowing it, were
passing beyond the boundaries of friendship into
the perplexing maze of love.</p>

<p>“Harry,” said Becky, suddenly, “where does
all the money come from?”</p>

<p>“Money, Becky! What money?”</p>

<p>“The money that gets us all we have at home.
Mother’s went long ago; and yet we are always
well supplied with food and clothing. Does it
come from your father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it does, Becky. My angel mother
possesses a key which unlocks all his treasures;
and I suspect that some of them fly across the
bridge to your home.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. It isn’t right. Is there not
some way in which I could earn money?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know of any. Stay. You
might blow the bellows for Fox, the blacksmith,
or get employment in the shipyard.”</p>

<p>“O, stop. That’s not what I want. Couldn’t
I work in one of the mills?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you could; but I wouldn’t,
at least until after we’ve had a consultation with
my angel mother.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s have one, quick. I’m determined
to earn money some way; and if you don’t find
me something better I <em>will</em> blow the bellows for
Mr. Fox.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come over to-night, and we’ll have
a grand council of war. Good by, Becky.”</p>

<p>“Good by, Harry.”</p>

<p>He turned up the road, and she stood and
watched him as he stepped briskly along, swinging
the key in his hand, and whistling merrily.</p>

<p>“He’s just splendid! O, if I was only a man,
to follow him into the world! For this life will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not content him long. He’s restless now, eager
to be at work among men. And he’ll go, too.
And, O, dear! how lonesome it will be without
him!”</p>

<p>Even then Becky felt a lonesome shadow gliding
into her heart with its oppressive weight,
felt the tears gathering in her eyes. Then, when
he was still in sight! How would it be when
he should be far, far away?</p>

<p>Yet she stood and watched as he descended
the hill, till he was out of sight; longer still,
her eyes fixed upon the spot from which he had
vanished, her thoughts shaping themselves into
queer notions of the future, in girlhood’s flattering
mirror of romance, building bright pictures
of renown for him,&mdash;her hero,&mdash;in which she
bore no part.</p>

<p>From this sudden romantic attack she was
aroused by the appearance of another figure in
the place on which her eyes were fixed. Slowly
toiling up the hill came a girl, pale-featured,
poorly-clad, deformed, and crippled. With the
aid of a crutch she stumped along the path until
she reached the school-house; then, with a pleasant
nod to Becky, and a sigh of relief, she
seated herself upon the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky returned the nod, and seated herself by
the side of the cripple.</p>

<p>“You seem to have a pretty hard time of it.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” said the cripple, smiling. “Well, I
suppose to you, who have two feet to run about
on, it does seem hard. But it’s the best I can
do, the best I ever could do; and so I don’t
mind it a bit.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you like being
a cripple,” said Becky, in astonishment. “I
never could be contented in that way&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I like it; but I cannot
help it. It must always be so. It’s hip trouble.
I only try to make the best of it. The hardest
to bear are the hard, grinding pains that come
sometimes. O, they are terrible! But they come
and go; and after they’re gone I’m real comfortable
till&mdash;the next.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a brave girl, any way,” said
Becky. “What’s your name, please?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know Jenny York? I
thought everybody knew me. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Becky Sleeper.”</p>

<p>“What! the tomboy?”</p>

<p>A dark shadow passed across the face of Becky.</p>

<p>“I was the tomboy, Jenny; but I’ve outgrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that name. I think I’m something a little nearer
what a girl of my age should be now.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for speaking so, Becky.
I’ve never met you before; but I’ve always heard
of you and your&mdash;your&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Capers, Jenny. Don’t be afraid. I don’t
mind it a bit. Thank goodness, I’ve outgrown
all that folly. But tell me, are you Silly York’s
sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She’s number one, and I’m number
two; then there’s Johnny, three, and four and
five. They’re little tots, and don’t count for
much yet. Silly works for Mrs. Thompson, and
I work at the mill.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> work! At what mill?”</p>

<p>“The paper mill, sorting rags. It’s profitable
business, too. Some weeks I make five or six
dollars.”</p>

<p>What a strange meeting! A little cripple
earning six dollars a week, and a great, strong,
healthy girl, who never earned a cent. Becky
could scarcely believe her ears.</p>

<p>“Why, Jenny York, you’re worth a dozen
girls like me. I never earned a cent in my life.
I wish I could, though.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough. Mr. Small wants some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
help; he told me so to-day. The work is not
very clean; there’s plenty of dust to get down
your throat, and up your nose, and into your
ears. But it never gets into my eyes thick
enough to prevent my seeing the wages every
Saturday night.”</p>

<p>Jenny York laughed merrily, making it evident
that the dust had no effect on her good
humor.</p>

<p>“There, I guess I’ve had a good rest. I must
be going.”</p>

<p>“Let me go with you,” said Becky, springing
up, and assisting Jenny to regain her feet.</p>

<p>“O, thank you! That will be nice. I can
put my arm about your waist, if you’ll let me,
and you can shoulder the crutch, if you like,
and ’twill be a pleasant change for me.”</p>

<p>Warm-hearted Becky quickly adjusted herself
to the requirements of her companion, and they
started off down the road.</p>

<p>“Do you walk up and down every day,
Jenny?”</p>

<p>“O, no. Almost always somebody comes
along and gives me a ride. Everybody is very
kind to me, and I get along famously.”</p>

<p>Ah, Jenny, if everybody had your cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
spirit, how much better and brighter the world
would become! how pleasantly we should all get
along! The hard, grinding times come to all,
in different shapes, to be rightly borne in
patience; but between the past and the coming
are long reaches of level life which the sunshine
of a contented spirit can make glad and happy.</p>

<p>That long walk opened a fresh path in the
new life to Becky. For two years Jenny York
had worked at the mill. She gave her companion
a full description of her duties, and eagerly
pressed her to come and try her luck. They
parted at the door of Mr. York’s house, sworn
friends. Becky, refusing an invitation to enter,
remembering her charity visit, gave Jenny her
promise that the next day should find her at the
mill.</p>

<p>So homeward tripped Becky, thanking her
lucky stars for this providential meeting, thinking
how oddly it had come about that just at
the right moment a weak, crippled girl had been
able to point out to her the road to independence.</p>

<p>The “council of war” that night deliberated
long and earnestly on the question which Becky
laid before that body. Harry opposed, Mrs.
Thompson hesitated, Becky was resolute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hate to oppose you, Harry, who have been
so good to me. But I can earn money there;
and it’s high time I did something for the support
of the family.”</p>

<p>She had taken the precaution to win Aunt
Hulda and her mother to her side before submitting
her plan to the others. Aunt Hulda,
whose admiration for Becky sometimes was
unbounded, had been first consulted. This mark
of confidence had won all that remained of Aunt
Hulda’s heart, and she readily acquiesced, as she
would have done had Becky proposed to shingle
the church. The mother had read in the sparkling
eyes of her daughter, now so very dear to
her, the earnest desire to work and earn, and
could not, if she would, disappoint her. Thus
thrice-armed in a just cause, Becky met her
councillors, and bore off the victory at last.</p>

<p>With these stipulations: she should give just
the time daily which had been occupied by her
school duties to rag-picking&mdash;no more. She
should perform her household labors as usual,
and be ready at other times for out-door exercise
at the will and pleasure of Harry Thompson.
His consent could be gained on no other
terms. Mrs. Thompson was doubtful of the influences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which might be brought to bear upon
Becky at the mill, yet could not but admire the
spirit she displayed. She hesitated on Becky’s
account a while, then smilingly gave her vote
in favor of Becky, and the field was won.</p>

<p>The next morning found her at the mill
equipped for dusty labor. Mr. Small received
her kindly, made a satisfactory bargain with her,
and she at once entered upon her duties.</p>

<p>The paper mill was composed of three buildings;
the main section, comprising the business
office, the machine-room, the pulp-vats, and the
bleaching-tubs, was built of bricks. At right
angles with this structure, and attached to it,
was a flat-roofed wooden building. In the lower
story of this were stored rags in bags; from this
room they were hoisted to the second story, where
they were sorted, then taken to the main building
to be bleached. At the end of this building
was a low, slant-roofed stable. In the sorting-room
from ten to a dozen females were usually
employed; and to this section of the paper mill
Becky was assigned.</p>

<p>To no pleasant work did Becky set her hands;
in no very pleasant companionship did she find
herself. With the exception of Jenny York, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
“girls” were middle aged and old women, loud-tongued,
and very apt to be quarrelsome. At
first Becky tried to make friends with all of
them; but, finding her overtures met with rudeness,
she desisted from further attempts, and
drew the closer to the little cripple.</p>

<p>As time passed on, and she grew familiar with
her labor, stronger grew her friendship for Jenny.
These two made a corner of their own, a little
removed from the Babel of tongues. Jenny,
rejoicing in the companionship of one so near
her age, was always bright and happy. Becky,
catching the inspiration of her cheerful spirit,
overflowed with mirth and humor, and oft-repeated
stories of tomboy adventures made them
both merry over their work.</p>

<p>But Becky never lost sight of her independence.
She worked gaily, but she worked with
a will; and the sight of her wages when Saturday
came was a reward of merit dearly prized.
Steadily she worked through the hot months of
summer, until she could count ninety dollars in
her strong-box; and then a sad disaster befell
the mill.</p>

<p>The machinery of a paper mill seldom stops,
night or day, save for repairs. It was in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
month of September that it was necessary to
stop for the repair of a broken wheel. The
sorting-room, however, was kept in operation.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock the “girls” repaired to their
homes for dinner&mdash;all but Jenny York. Occasionally
Becky staid to keep her company, but
not often, the stipulations with the council requiring
her to be punctual to her meals at home.
Certainly Jenny fared all the better for this, for
Becky’s return always added something nice to
her plain fare.</p>

<p>But one day Jenny had a fierce attack of her
grinding pains, and all the forenoon she lay upon
a couch of bags, and when dinner time came,
spite of her wishes, Becky would not leave her.
They were alone; Jenny, just recovering, was
faint and ghostly white; Becky, bending over
her, was bathing her temples, when, suddenly,
outside, the cry of “Fire!” was raised. Becky
sprang to her feet, to find the room thickening
with smoke, coming up through the chinks in
the floor. A too common accident in paper
mills had occurred. A bag of cotton waste had
burst into flames, and the store-room beneath
was a furnace of fire. Her first thought was&mdash;no
thought at all. The instinct of self-preservation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
took her into the machine-room very quick,
and then she thought of Jenny. She ran back
to the terrified girl, crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, Jenny. The mill’s on
fire; but I’ll save you.”</p>

<p>She stooped and lifted Jenny in her arms.
All the “waste” of her early life served her
well now. Exercise had made that small frame
tough and muscular, and she easily bore Jenny
towards the door. But suddenly the iron doors
between the two buildings were closed with a
crash. Some crazy operative, thinking only of
the danger to the main building, had taken this
precaution, without looking into the room. Becky
dropped her burden, and flew to the doors. She
screamed for help; she beat the iron with her
fists in vain. Then she ran to the windows on
the sides; there were none at the end. But the
thick, black smoke, rolling up outside, obscured
the light. No escape there; they were walled
in on every side. The smoke in the room was
so thick it was with difficulty they could breathe.</p>

<p>No escape? Yes, one. Becky cast her eyes
aloft. In the centre of the roof was a scuttle,
ten feet above her. Lying along the side of the
room was a ladder. Becky sprang for it. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was very heavy; but desperation nerved her
arms, and it was raised.</p>

<p>All this time Jenny lay upon the floor, watching
with wishful eyes the movements of Becky.
O, if she only had a little strength now! Becky
came to her side, and raised her once more in
her arms.</p>

<p>“Now clasp me close, and we’ll soon reach
the roof, and be out of this stifling smoke, any
way.”</p>

<p>With her heavy burden she toiled up the ladder,
rested a moment at the top, then threw up
the scuttle, and reached the roof. There she
laid Jenny down and ran to the edge. Right
and left the smoke was rising in dense volumes;
but at the farther end all was clear, and beneath
it was the steep roof of the stable. There was
her chance for escape. She could drop easily;
it was but ten feet. But Jenny! The poor girl
would scarce escape without injury. Only a
moment she pondered, then ran back to the scuttle,
and descended the ladder, at the risk of her
life. Near the iron doors the flames were shooting
up through the floor, and dancing on the
wall. The smoke was stifling. She caught up
several empty bags, and quickly regained her
place upon the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quick, Jenny, quick! Help me to tear these
bags to pieces. We must have a rope.”</p>

<p>They tore the bags apart, divided them, with
the aid of their scissors, into long, narrow strips;
then Becky’s nimble fingers twisted them
together.</p>

<p>“Now, Jenny, I’m going to lower you to the
shed; and then we’re safe.”</p>

<p>She fastened the improvised rope about Jenny’s
waist, and bore her to the edge of the roof.
She then passed the rope around the chimney.</p>

<p>“Once more, Jenny. Slide over the roof, and
hold on to the rope.”</p>

<p>The rope slid through Becky’s hands, and
Jenny was upon the roof below. Then the brave
girl, casting loose the trusty cord, advanced to
the edge of the roof, and, supporting herself a
moment by her hands, dropped beside her friend.
None too soon; for, while she clung there, up
through the scuttle appeared the flaming head
of the advancing column of fire.</p>

<p>It was still ten feet from the stable to the
ground, and no time to be lost.</p>

<p>“Slide down the roof, Jenny, and drop again.
I’ll hold you; never fear.”</p>

<p>She stretched herself flat upon the roof, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the rope in her hands. Jenny slid down, and
dropped as directed. But now a new danger to
Becky arose: the cord had become entangled
in her dress; and, as Jenny descended, she
found herself being dragged down the roof. But
she held all the tighter to the rope, fearing the
shock to Jenny, should she fall, more than the
danger of being herself plunged headlong from
the roof. Faster and faster they went; she was
nearing the edge; she must go over. No. Suddenly
the cord slacked. Jenny had touched the
ground. She dropped the cord, clutched the
gutter with all her strength, her body swung
round, and she dropped to the ground, very
ungracefully, but unhurt.</p>

<p>“O, Becky, you’ve saved my life! Can I ever
repay you.”</p>

<p>Jenny lay upon the ground, with clasped hands
and streaming eyes. Becky stood by her side,
looking ruefully at the burning building. No
more work there.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jenny, I believe I’ve saved both our
lives. But there’s one thing I forgot; and it’s
just like me. Your crutch! I might have saved
that too.”</p>

<p>Not quite a thoughtful, earnest woman yet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Becky; but this day the climbing frolics of the
tomboy days have enabled you to glorify
humanity with its proudest triumph&mdash;an heroic
act!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">TEDDY SLEEPER DINES OUT.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p145.jpg" width="27" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-J">Just before the breaking out of the fire in
the paper mill Teddy Sleeper, sat on the
door step awaiting the return of his
sister. He was particularly uneasy on this occasion,
having had a long spell of fishing with no
luck, “not even a bite” and was very impatient
at the delay in obtaining a “bite” at home, it
being the invariable rule there, to wait for
Becky. Teddy under the wise rule of his sister
had lost much of his gaukiness and rough speech
but had lost none of his rotundity of form and
cool, phlegmatic disposition. With him everything
was taken as a matter of course. Nothing
ever surprised him into expressions of wonder,
and seldom did he lose his temper. The sole
disturber of his peace was hunger&mdash;the foe that
has successfully assailed the good disposition
of many wise and great men. Under its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
attacks Teddy grew restless and disorderly. He
was in a fair way to do something rash, when
his keen eye discovered smoke rolling up over
the paper mill, and the cry of “Fire! fire! fire!”
faintly reached his ears. He rolled off the step,
took a long look in the direction of the smoke,
then started down the hill. Reaching the church,
he saw Phil Hague standing before the captain’s
house, shading his eyes and looking up the road.
People were hurrying toward the fire.</p>

<p>“Phil, Phil, it’s the paper mill!”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Bedad, its foine kindlings they
have there for a blaze.”</p>

<p>“Come on. Let’s get out the ingine.”</p>

<p>“What for, I dunno?” said Phil, scratching
his head.</p>

<p>“To put out the fire. Here, Jackson, the
ingine. Hold on, Smith, help run her up.
Come on, Phil.”</p>

<p>Teddy run to the engine house, followed by
Phil, and Smith and Jackson, who were on
their way to the fire.</p>

<p>The engine was kept next door to the church.
It was a heavy, old-fashioned affair, not much
larger than a good-sized wash-tub, had not been
moved for years, and it was very doubtful if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
could be made to work. Of this Teddy took
no thought. There was a fire, and the first
thing to be done was to have it on the spot.
So they pulled it out and started down the hill
as fast as they could run. Not being experienced
firemen, they did not use any “hold-back”
measures, and the consequence was, half
way down the hill they found the “ingine”
close upon their heels, and themselves in danger
of being crushed. With one accord they dropped
the rope, and sprang to the sides of the road.
“Cataract”&mdash;this was the name by which the
extinguisher was known&mdash;being deserted by its
leaders, went thundering down the hill and tipped
over at the bottom.</p>

<p>“By my sowl,” said Phil Hague, “that’s a
quare way of putting out a fire. The contrary
divil’s laid down for a nap.”</p>

<p>“Come on, it ain’t hurt; let’s set it up and
lug it up the hill,” said Teddy hurrying to the
prostrate Cataract.</p>

<p>They managed to get it upon its wheels again,
tugged up the hill with their heavy burden,
and at last reached the fire. A hose was laid
and the engine manned, but the rusty machine
refused to work. All this time Teddy had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
sweating and hurrying to get it in operation.
It was a sore disappointment to him after all
his trouble.</p>

<p>Mark Small came along at that moment.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, boys, there’s been no washers on
them pumps this five years.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh from the crowd and Teddy
turned away with a very red face.</p>

<p>“The best engine in the world would be of
no use now. She’s got to burn,” said Small,
looking at his buildings, now enveloped in flames.
“Much obliged to you, Teddy, all the same.
Tell you what you can do. There’s little York
frightened most to death. Becky got her out
just in time. Just you take my team and get
her home. That’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p>Teddy followed the direction of Small’s pointing
finger, and saw Jenny York crouching on
the ground beside Becky. In a moment he was
beside the girls.</p>

<p>“Hello, girls, had a narrow squeak of it. Say,
Becky, Small says you got her out. Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, Teddy. Ain’t you glad?” said
Becky.</p>

<p>“Glad; you bet I am. Bully for you. Hurrah
for Becky Sleeper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowd took up the shout, and Becky
received an ovation. Just then Small drove up
in his wagon.</p>

<p>“Come, Teddy, get the girls home, quick.”</p>

<p>He leaped from his seat and took Jenny in
his arms and placed her in the wagon.</p>

<p>“There’s room for you, too, Becky. Jump
in. God bless you, girl. It’s hard to lose all I
have in the world, but it would have been
harder to bear had there been a life lost.”</p>

<p>Becky climbed into the wagon followed by
Teddy who took up the reins and drove away.
As they moved off the excited crowd, who had
witnessed Becky’s valor, shouted until Becky
was out of sight, “Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!”
As they flew down the road Jenny poured into
the ears of Teddy Sleeper the exciting narrative
of the escape.</p>

<p>“That’s just like her, Jenny. Hi, lively,
Spotty. She’s a bouncer, I tell you. And she’s
my sister. Ain’t I proud of her? Oh, no&mdash;get
up, Spotty,” cried Teddy, at the conclusion
of the narrative. “And I lugged that plaguy
old ingine up all for nothing. She does all the
brave things, and I ain’t no account. Don’t
care, she’s my sister. Hi, there, Spotty, what
are ye about? She’s my sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Spotty was the name of Small’s horse&mdash;an
explanation rather necessary, in view of the
manner in which Teddy mixed his sentences.</p>

<p>Having safely deposited his sister at home,
Teddy drove on to Jenny’s house. Mrs. York
was surprised at the appearance of Jenny in the
middle of the day. The family had heard nothing
about the fire, and were about sitting down
to dinner when Teddy arrived with his charge.</p>

<p>“Bless the child, where did you come from?
What’s the matter?” cried Mrs. York, appearing
in the doorway, as Teddy carefully deposited
Jenny on the step.</p>

<p>“Been a fire! Mill’s gone&mdash;clean gone!”
said Teddy. “So I brought Jenny home.”</p>

<p>“Mill’s burned? Sakes alive! How on earth
did you get out? Do you hear that, father?
Mill’s gone&mdash;clean gone.”</p>

<p>“I got out because Becky Sleeper saved me,
mother,” said Jenny, quietly, as she took her
mother’s hand to get into the house. “Had it
not been for her you’d have had no crippled
daughter to care for more.”</p>

<p>“My gracious! you don’t mean it,” cried Mrs.
York, hastily closing the door, regardless of
Teddy standing outside. Teddy turned away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with a disappointed air. The grateful incense
of a boiled dinner had been wafted to his hungry
spirit, through the open door. He remembered
the time, when on a charitable mission,
that same door had been closed to him, and
thought that if a little charity should be extended
to him from the other side, hungry as he
was he could not refuse it. He climbed to his
seat, took up the reins, and was on the point of
starting off when the door opened again.</p>

<p>“Here, Teddy, Teddy Sleeper, don’t go yet.”
It was the voice of Mrs. York. “You mustn’t
mind my shuttin’ the door. I’m so flurried to
think that our Jenny’s come so near never
comin’ home again. Come in and have some
dinner. We ain’t got much, but what we have
is good, for I cooked it myself. Don’t be bashful.
Come in, and welcome.”</p>

<p>Teddy stopped not for further invitation, but
quickly fastened Spotty and entered the house.
The table was spread in the middle of the room,
its centre embellished with a huge platter in
which reposed a smoking piece of corned-beef,
almost hidden by the surrounding accompaniment
of turnips, carrots, parsnips, cabbage and
potatoes. Near it was an enormous dish of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
squash. There was a plate of brown bread,
another of white, a castor, a huge coffee pot,
cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks.
Teddy took it all in at a glance. There was
enough for all, he should not be robbing the
poor if he helped to dispose of the feast. Yet
the supply of squash so far exceeded the usual
provision made for such an occasion that he
could not keep his eyes from it.</p>

<p>“Father” York who was on the lounge, when
he entered raised his eyes and said “How
do you do?” in a very weak voice.</p>

<p>“Come, father, dinner’s all on the table.”</p>

<p>“Father” rose quickly, and took his place at
the foot of the table. Mrs. York motioned
Teddy to a seat next him. Jenny took her
place, and the two younger Yorks, about four
and six years old scrambled to their places.</p>

<p>“Why, where’s Johnny?” said Mrs. York,
about to do the honors at the head of the table.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be here afore we get through, I
guess,” said father York, “he never loses a
meal.”</p>

<p>There was a scrambling at the back door, it
flew open, and Johnny York made his appearance.
He was about eleven years old. A redheaded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
freckled-faced boy, with eyes like a
sculpin. With much haste he tossed his hat on
the lounge, dragged a chair across the floor,
jumped into his seat, and fastened his eyes upon
the dish of squash.</p>

<p>“Squash!” he ejaculated, lifting his plate.</p>

<p>“Wait, sonny, wait; don’t you see we have
company,” said Mrs. York.</p>

<p>Johnny looked round the table, saw Teddy,
grinned, then fastened his eyes on his favorite
dish.</p>

<p>Mrs. York helped Teddy and Jenny and then
looked at Johnny.</p>

<p>“Squash,” answered Johnny to the look.</p>

<p>Into his plate Mrs. York heaped the yellow
vegetable in such profusion that Teddy stared.
The youngster seemed not a bit discouraged by
the supply but attacked it at once. The two
smaller children were also helped from the
same dish, paying no attention to the contents
of the principal platter. With a great many
groans Mr. York supplied his own plate bountifully,
and set to work like a man ravenously
hungry. Teddy kept him company&mdash;he had
fasted long and he was tempted by a favorite
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Teddy,” said Mrs. York, “we can never be
grateful enough to that dear sister of yours,
and only think, we turned her away from our
doors.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Mr. York, “and refused her
bounty. It was cruel, and if ever there was a
thing a poor sick man hankered for, it was
what she brought.”</p>

<p>“Squash!” burst out Johnny, raising his empty
plate.</p>

<p>Teddy stopped eating and looked at Johnny.
The boy’s eyes stood out hungrier than ever.
Mrs. York quietly refilled his plate.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s the dearest girl, mother, you ever
saw. If you’d only seen her in the loft,” said
Jenny, “tugging away at that great ladder, and
then carrying me up in her arms, and so gay
about it, as though she did it every day. I was
frightened almost to death, but when I saw how
calm she was, it made me quiet. I thought if
I must die, it would not be alone. And then I
thought that was selfish and wanted her to go
and leave me to my fate. Oh, mother, it was
a happy day for me when she came to the
mill.”</p>

<p>“It was a happy day for us all, Jenny,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mrs. York. “What should we do without our
singing Jenny? Have some more beef, Teddy.
I declare you’re not eating anything.”</p>

<p>Teddy looked up to see if she was not making
fun of him for he had already made away
with two generous supplies. But, no, there was
no fun in her eye, and he passed his plate.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sighed Mr. York, “we have much to
be grateful for. Poor health is an awful pullback
to a man who’s willin’ to do all he can,
but to lose children after they’ve begun to earn
something, is a special dispensation of Providence
that goes agin’ the grain. I always told
Small that mill of his would end in&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Squash!” sung out Johnny, lifting an empty
plate again.</p>

<p>“Squash!” echoed number four.</p>

<p>“Squash!” chimed in number five.</p>

<p>Teddy saw three uplifted plates and ceased to
wonder at the enormous provision. Without a
murmur Mrs. York plied the big iron spoon
once more, and the youngsters again set to
work.</p>

<p>“And to think that girl should turn out so
well after all,” said Mrs. York. “She was the
most harum scarum thing I ever saw when she
was a young girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, we must never judge by appearances,”
sighed Mr. York. “That’s what I tell Mason
when I have my bad spells come on. ‘York,’
he says, ‘don’t be a fool. You’re tough enough
if you only keep to work. You’re as strong and
healthy a looking man as I am.’ Ah, he little
knows what a sinking there is my stomach and
how weak I get, and don’t have the least bit
of appetite. Ah, I’m slowly but surely fading
away, fading away.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, father, don’t talk so. You make me
feel miserable,” said Mrs. York, laying down
her knife and looking at the sufferer with real
distress in her face.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t,” sighed York, taking up his
knife and fork, and dashing at his plate with
vigor. “I know its wrong to distress you, but
what can a man do who feels the all-devouring
worm continually crying&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Squash!” interrupted Johnny.</p>

<p>“No, sir, no more,” said Mrs. York, firmly.
“Mercy sakes, do you want to turn into a
squash vine, and have squashes grow out all
over you? No more.”</p>

<p>Johnny said not a word, but pushed back his
chair, grabbed his cap, and slid out of the back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
door. The little Yorks who were on the point
of joining their petitions with that of their
brother, awed by the stern tone of their mother,
or frightened at the probable result of too much
indulgence, dropped their plates and were silent.
Teddy, having fully appeased his appetite, thought
of Spotty.</p>

<p>“I believe I must be goin’. Hadn’t ought to
have stopped so long. Mr. Small will be wanting
his horse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be in a hurry, Teddy. Well, if
you must go&mdash;come again, we’ll be glad to see
you any time, won’t we, father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; and your sister, too, and she
shan’t be turned out of doors, if she ever feels
like bringing something nice to a poor sick
man,” said Mr. York.</p>

<p>“Don’t, father, speak of such a thing,” cried
Jenny. “She’s done enough for us. Don’t take
such a message as that, Teddy, but tell her we
all love her dearly, and will never think of her
but as the best girl in Cleverly.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jenny. I knew folks would find
out how clever she is,” said Teddy, “and she’s
my sister. Good by. I really must be going,”
and he started for the door. Outside he found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Spotty impatiently pulling at his tether, and
jumping into the wagon he started off. As he
drove into the main street he found a group of
men and boys discussing the fire, and by their
motions enacting the scene in which Becky had
taken a prominent part. Further on another
group with the same subject under consideration,
and a third were on the steps of the church.
As he passed he could hear his sister’s name
spoken by one and another. In a cheerful spirit,
with his hungry foe completely vanquished, it is
no wonder that Teddy’s heart glowed at the
praises he heard, and felt proud of its connection
with the heroine of the day.</p>

<p>And Becky; how bore she her triumph? Quietly
she entered the house and took her place
at her mother’s side.</p>

<p>“No more work to-day, mother, or for many
days. The mill is burned to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Nobody hurt, Becky?” with an anxious look,
said the mother.</p>

<p>“No, all safe and sound. Nobody lost anything
but Mr. Small.”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda entered the room at that moment.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Becky? Where have you been?
Dinner’s cold as a stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jenny was very sick and I couldn’t leave
her, and then the mill took fire and burnt to
the ground.”</p>

<p>“Mark Small’s mill burnt. You don’t mean
it. Why, it will ruin him,” gasped Aunt Hulda.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid he’s lost everything.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, dear, dear! It’s the Lord’s doin’s
and I ’spose we must be resigned,” cried Aunt
Hulda. “And Mark Small’s lost everything,”
and she sat down and rocked briskly, wringing
her hands.</p>

<p>“Why, Aunt Hulda, what ails you? You’ll
lose nothing. Come, give me my dinner, I’m as
hungry as a bear. I can’t wait; come along,”
and Becky seized Aunt Hulda by main force
and dragged her to the kitchen. Not a word
about her adventure to Aunt Hulda, not a
word to her mother on her return. They were
left in ignorance until Teddy puffing with haste
burst into the room. He ran at Becky and
seized her in his arms.</p>

<p>“It’s all over town. I tell you, everybody’s
talking about you. You’re a heroine, Becky,
and I’m your brother.”</p>

<p>“What on airth ails the boy?” shrieked Aunt
Hulda. “Is he mad? What’s Becky done
now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“What has she done, Aunt Hulda? She
dragged Jenny York up on the roof, tore up the
bags and let her down to the ground, when the
building was blazing like fury. D’ye hear that,
mother? Our Becky did it. Ain’t you proud
of her? I am.”</p>

<p>Becky freed herself from Teddy’s embrace,
wondering what could have started him to such
a proceeding, he always so cool and undemonstrative.
She looked at her mother. The face
of the invalid was flushed, the lips moved yet
no words escaped them, but in the eyes Becky
read the rich reward, “Well done, daughter.”
She ran to her mother’s side and put her arms
about her neck.</p>

<p>“Poor Jenny York, mother, she must have
died without me. Thank Heaven, I was there,
mother. Thank Him that I knew how to save
her.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">THE ROMANCE OF A POOR OLD MAID.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p161.jpg" width="27" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-I">If ever a man had reason to be disappointed
at the ways of Providence, that man was
Mark Small, owner of the mill, whose
earthly possessions had vanished in fire and smoke.
Twenty years before, he had wandered over from
Foxtown, a sunburnt lad, with all his wardrobe&mdash;a
cotton shirt, homespun pants, and a straw
hat, stuck loosely upon his thin frame,&mdash;and the
sad recollection of the death-bed of his father,
a dissipated laborer, firmly fixed in his memory. In
search of a job he stumbled into Capt. Thompson’s
kitchen, where he was treated to a good,
warm meal, and afterwards given charge of
the captain’s “cattle;” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</i> a lively young horse,
and a quiet, orderly cow,&mdash;for the captain’s
domestic establishment was then on a very small
scale. This work contented him for five years;
when a desire to become a tin-peddler, induced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the captain to equip him with a horse and wagon,
and to set him off upon his travels. A very
promising year at this business was ended by
the disappearance of his whole stock from the
breaking of a bridge; and the bankruptcy of that
concern was the consequence. Then he tried
book-peddling with considerable success, until
one night the barn, in which he and his library
had taken shelter from a storm, was struck by
lightning and burned; he barely escaping with
his life. Then he took to farming;&mdash;cut his
leg with a scythe, and was laid up all winter.
So fast failures followed all his attempts to
rise in the world, that he jestingly asserted he
must have been named Mark, that misfortune
might make no mistake in marking him for its
victim. At length he sought employment at the
paper mill, where he prospered; and in time, by
careful saving and shrewd management, was able
to purchase the whole concern. And now fire had
again made him penniless. Yet he sat there,
lounging on a stone, humming a tune, and whittling
a stick, as the twilight was gathering, and the
flickering flames dying out of all that remained of
his earthly possessions. He was a tall, thin man,
with hollow cheeks, a ring of grizzled beard encircling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
his throat, a long, sharp nose, and a pair of
rambling, piercing eyes, which were now fastened
upon the fast blackening heap before him. So
deeply was he interested in the last flashes of
his expiring treasures, that he was unconscious
of the approach of footsteps, until a hand was
laid upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mark, if it wasn’t the Lord’s doings, I should
say that you’re the worst treated man in Cleverly.”</p>

<p>Mark started, and turned to see the sharp eyes
of Hulda Prime looking into his eagerly. He
was not quite sure, but he thought they looked
moist and watery.</p>

<p>“Yes, Hulda, the old tune’s struck up again,”&mdash;by
which Mark meant his old follower, misfortune&mdash;“I’d
kinder lost the hang of it, so long
since I’ve heeded it, but now it seems jist as
natral as ‘auld lang syne.’”</p>

<p>“Mark, I’m real sorry for you. I don’t know
as I’m welcome, but I couldn’t help putting on
my bunnet and coming over to see you, if ’twas
only for the sake of ‘auld lang syne’ you tell
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s real kind of you, Hulda; something
I couldn’t expect; for I hain’t treated you
jest right, nohow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Hulda shivered; it couldn’t be with cold,
for the warmth of the failing embers was still
powerful.</p>

<p>“Seems queer you should drop down on me
jest then, Hulda; for I’ve been kinder lookin’
back, and jest when you put your hand on my
shoulder, I was thinkin’ of that day when horse,
wagon, tin-ware and peddler, went through the
bridge together.”</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda shivered again, and somehow
managed to slip down by Small’s side. He took
no notice of the circumstance, but went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, you were stopping with Mrs. Johnson,
helping her with her thanksgiving. You were
a smart girl those days. Not handsome, but
kinder good, wholesome lookin’. Don’t you
remember my coming round to the kitchen and
jokin’ you about Cyrus Cheever, who was kinder
makin’ up to you; and I sung out to you,
‘Don’t have him, Hulda, wait for me. I’ll call
when I come back, and pop the question.’ But
I drove off and popped through the bridge.
Don’t you remember it?”</p>

<p>Hulda Prime answered not. Her elbows were
on her knees, her chin in her hand, her eyes
looking into the gleaming ruins, where broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
walls and twisted machinery, stood as monuments
of destruction.</p>

<p>Remember it! had she not waited for that
return? had she not taken to heart those playful
words? And out of them woven a bright dream,
and built upon it year by year, the only romance
of her solitary life.</p>

<p>“I meant it, Hulda, true as gospel I meant it.”</p>

<p>Hulda’s old heart gave a bound. It was no
jest after all.</p>

<p>“Yes, if it hadn’t been for that accident, I
should have come back and asked you Hulda,
true as preaching. But the old tune struck up,
and ’twas no use trying to get up a wedding-dance
to such music as that. And then when I
got in luck again, somehow, I kinder got stuck
up, and got used to being my own master; but
I did keep kinder thinkin’ on you. But what’s
the use of my tellin’ you all this? we’ve got by,
all that nonsense, and I’m flat on by back agin,
and as ‘poor as a puddock.’ I don’t s’pose it’s
very manly in me to go confessing this thing
now; but I’ve kinder felt mean about it, and
your comin’, so cleverly and neighborly like, when
I’ve nobody to feel sorry for me, has sorter made
me do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark Small shifted about uneasily in his seat,
and whittled very briskly, and tried to whistle;
but he found it hard to “pucker,” and could
not muster a note.</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda shivered, and looked off into the
ruins; and nursed her chin in her hand, and
thought, “‘We’ve got by all that nonsense,’
have we?” Perhaps he had. She had not. No!
Mark Small had been the idol of her younger
days&mdash;her hero&mdash;by no means a handsome
one; neither brave or gifted; yet she had loved
him dearly, without any hope of being his
wife, and now to find that he had thought of her,
had wished to marry her, was happiness enough
to pay for all the waiting, though they might
never come any nearer to each other,&mdash;though, as
he said, “they had got by all that nonsense.”</p>

<p>She spoke at last.</p>

<p>“Mark, I’m glad you told me this. You
needn’t be ashamed of it, neither. It’s a manly
thing for you to do. It’s wiped out some hard
thoughts I’ve had of you; for I want you to
understand that if you’d come back then, Cyrus
Cheever, or any other man, would have been
no consequence at all.”</p>

<p>And because all that nonsense had died out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Hulda’s hand fell upon Mark’s, and the ruined
paper maker dropped his knife, and clasped it;
and both gazed wistfully into the ruins, as the
twilight darkened, and the fires burned dimmer.</p>

<p>“Mark, I am so sorry for you. What will
you do now? Your mill is ruined. ’Twill take
a heap of money to build it up again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Hulda; but I ain’t a bit scart.
I’ve begun too many times at the bottom of the
ladder, to give up now.”</p>

<p>“Trust in the Lord, Mark, trust in the Lord.”</p>

<p>“That’s good, pious doctrine, Hulda, but I’m
kinder unsteady on religious pints, and I think
the Lord does the handsome thing, when he gives
us this world, with all its fruits and products,
and store of materials to work and weave, and
brains to think, and arms to work; and we serve
him best when we take all this, on trust, and
turn it over, and work it up, and do the very
best we can, givin’ him the glory. That’s my
religion, Hulda, and I mean to live by it. And
if I can do that, I ain’t afraid it won’t carry
me over the river. I ain’t agoin’ to trouble him
to set me goin’, but jest look ’round, find suthin’
to do, and then pitch in with a will.”</p>

<p>Hulda groaned in spirit, but kept her lips fast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
closed. This was not exactly what Parson
Arnold preached, and the self-reliant religion of
Mark Small, had a shade of blasphemy to her
orthodox ears.</p>

<p>“Hulda, I wouldn’t sit here any longer if I
were you. It’s getting dark and cold. I’ll walk
down the road with you. It’s good of you to
come, and I think I feel better for getting to
be good friends with you again. I thought the
old feelin’ had died out, but it hain’t, and if ever
I get on my feet agen,&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mark Small?”</p>

<p>A burly form came between them and the
light. Hulda recognized it, and sprang to her
feet. Captain Thompson, the last man she
expected to meet stood before them. She darted
back of Mark Small, out of the light. The
captain took no notice of her, supposing her one
of the employees of the mill.</p>

<p>“Yes, Captain, here I am, watching the remains.
The old mill’s done for&mdash;and so am I.”</p>

<p>The captain came forward with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>“Mark, I am sorry for you. If it had been
one of my ships, I couldn’t have felt worse. I’ve
been out of town all day. Just heard of it.
Swept clean away, hey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain, all gone. Some of the machinery
might be saved, but it can do no good. What’s
the use of a horse, if you can’t get a stable for
him?”</p>

<p>“Well, the first thing to do is to build a
stable for your iron horses.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to talk, but where’s the
money coming from?”</p>

<p>“How much will it take to set the mill agoing
again?”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars,” said Mark, with a
very faint whistle.</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars!” echoed the captain,
with a louder whistle. “Any insurance?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent’s worth!” said Mark; “it’s too
risky. You see a little combustible cotton has
swept away my fortune in a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>“Nobody hurt, was there?” queried the captain.</p>

<p>“No. Thanks to brave little Becky Sleeper,
even the little cripple was got out. That’s a brave
girl, Captain. She’ll be the town talk to-morrow.
Her skill in climbing and lifting stood her friend
to-day. She’s a wide-awake Sleeper. Pity we
hadn’t more tomboys like her about.”</p>

<p>“She of any use? you surprise me, Mark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Hulda drew a step nearer. With her pet for a
subject, the conversation was becoming interesting.</p>

<p>“Yes, while the building was in flames, she
dragged Jenny York to the roof, and lowered her
to the ground;” and Small related the adventure,
painting in glowing colors the heroism of Becky
Sleeper.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the captain at the close of
the narrative, “I’m glad she’s done something
to redeem her bad character.”</p>

<p>Hulda Prime took another step forward, and
clenched her fist. The captain never knew how
narrowly he escaped an assault. “The ugly
brute!” she thought, “he should repent that
speech.” But remembering she had no right to
interfere in that place, she smothered her ruffled
feelings, and listened.</p>

<p>“And you say ten thousand dollars would be
required to rebuild the mill. A big sum, a very
big sum;” and the captain rubbed his hand
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, the stock’s gone clean; but my agent
in Boston would fill me up, if I could only get
the mill on its legs again.”</p>

<p>“Hem! pays good profit, hey?” asked the
captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Splendid! I had a customer for all I could
make. Might rebuild on shares with my agents.
I guess they’d come down with five thousand, if
I could show the other five.”</p>

<p>“Would they,” said the captain, lighting up,
“then you’re all right, Small. All right! build
it up and set it agoing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but where’s my five thousand coming
from?”</p>

<p>“Out of my pocket, Small. ’Tain’t the first
time I’ve set you up in business. And though
you’ve failed many times, I’ve never lost a cent.
You’ve paid me up principal and interest. And
the money’s yours, when you want it to set things
agoing. And if your agents won’t go in with
you, why, I will; though where so much money’s
coming from, I can’t exactly see.”</p>

<p>Small sprang to his feet, with eyes full of
tears.</p>

<p>“Captain Thompson, you’re a friend worth
having; you’ve put new life into me. I thought
my best friend was gone when the old mill burnt;
but I’m all right now.” And he seized Captain
Thompson’s hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Small. Don’t say any more
about it. And don’t let it leak out; I don’t like
to have my doings known.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“But they shall be known, you ugly old angel,”
cried Hulda Prime, pouncing upon the Captain,
and shaking his hand with energy.</p>

<p>“Hulda Prime, you here!” cried the astonished
Captain; backing away and endeavoring to release
his hand,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes, and I bless the Lord I am here, to see
such a noble spirit. Captain Thompson, I’ve
said hard things about you, and to your face,
too; but I take ’em all back,&mdash;except about
Harry&mdash;that I will stick to.”</p>

<p>Remembering what had been said about Harry,
the Captain was not well pleased at the reservation.</p>

<p>“Miss Prime, I am surprised to find you here,”
began he, sternly.</p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t be. Mark Small and I
are old friends, and so I ran over to console
him and bid him trust in the Lord. And I
guess he did, after all, for nobody else could
have sent you here just in the nick of time.
You’re just splendid. Folks round here pity
Miss Thompson because she’s got such a brute
of a husband. But they needn’t. You’re just
as good as you can be, and I’ve a great mind
to hug you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The Captain grew red, and the Captain grew
pale. He never felt in such deadly peril before.</p>

<p>“Come, Captain, shake hands and forgive me.”</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand. The Captain hesitated&mdash;then
took it.</p>

<p>“You’ll never regret this night’s work as long
as you live,&mdash;never! And I’ll never go to sleep
at night without a prayer for Captain Thompson.”</p>

<p>“Pray as much as you please, Hulda; I shall
need it all. But if we are to be friends, not a
word of what has been said to-night, in Cleverly.
You understand?”</p>

<p>“If you insist on hiding your light under a
bushel, I’m not mean enough to kick it over without
your consent. But it’s a shame. Everybody
ought to know what a good man you are.”</p>

<p>The Captain turned on his heel. “Good night,
Hulda! Good night, Mark! I’ll see you in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Captain! You’ve made my sleep
hearty to-night,” cried Small.</p>

<p>“Good night, Captain. God bless you!”
cried Hulda. And so they parted.</p>

<p>The Captain laughed to himself, as he marched
into the road; but there he met his son Harry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
He pulled his hat over his eyes, and without
recognition passed him by as he would a stranger.</p>

<p>“The Lord sent him, Mark, to-night, you
believe that?” said Hulda, as the Captain disappeared.</p>

<p>“The Lord put a noble heart in his breast, and
it turned him toward the old mill. It’s the
same thing, Hulda; but you and I look at it in
a different light. Now I’ll beau you home. You
don’t get a beau every night, Hulda.”</p>

<p>“I never wanted but one, and he never happened
along until to-night.”</p>

<p>They laughed merrily and started off, arm in
arm, only a few steps, and they came plump
upon Harry Thompson.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Small, is that you? I came up to
offer a little friendly consolation, but you seem
in good spirits. What, Aunt Hulda, you here!
What’s the meaning of this?” and Harry for
once, looked very sober.</p>

<p>“The fire is all out, Harry,” said Small, confused.</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Harry, “There’s no danger of
its rekindling.” He looked hard at Aunt Hulda.
He could not understand the situation. Until
now, he supposed the two were strangers. Their
confused manner was a puzzle, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s no vestige of a flame there,” said
Small, “not a spark. All dead and gone.”</p>

<p>Harry looked as though there was a flame very
near to Small, but said nothing about it.</p>

<p>“I just ran up to look after you, Small, to
see that you did not get down in the mouth,
and to say for my mother, that if you need help,
there’s money in her purse at your command.
Good night! Look out for the sparks, Aunt
Hulda.” And with a laugh he turned on his
heel and walked away.</p>

<p>“Wonder if the Lord sent him?” growled
Mark. Aunt Hulda said nothing. The situation
in which she found herself, was very awkward,
and she trudged along with her arm in Mark’s,
very much like a lamb led to slaughter. This
could not continue long however, and e’er
they reached the Sleeper place, their tongues
were loosened, and they found themselves building
castles as airy and fleecy as lovers are
accustomed to shape in the years allotted to
youth and romance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">BECKY BEARDS THE LION IN HIS DEN.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p176.jpg" width="49" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-W">With the burning of the mill, Becky’s
march towards independence was stayed
for a while by the failure of supplies.
There was a disposition on the part of Cleverly
folks to lionize the young girl for the brave
deed she had accomplished. Much to her surprise,
people who had before shunned her took
particular pains to call and thank her for the
heroism she had displayed. Deacon Procter’s
wife&mdash;a woman who, in the tomboy days, had
caught her among the melons, who had told her
she was on the broad road to destruction&mdash;smiled
upon her kindly, patted her cheek, and
called her a brave, good girl, and the pride of
the town. Parson Arnold, who before had pulled
his hat over his eyes, and stepped one side, when
he met her, now benevolently laid his hand upon
her head, with a blessing. Even the boys&mdash;Teddy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cronies&mdash;gathered about the house, and,
on her appearance at the door or the window,
testified their approbation of her conduct by loud
and prolonged cheering; while buxom Mrs. York
visited the house regularly every day for a week,
to clasp Becky in her arms with such a strength
of gratitude that the girl really feared the breath
would be driven from her body.</p>

<p>All this was a source of wonder to her. She
had felt a glow of pleasure when she saw the
flush on her mother’s cheek, the tears standing
in her eyes, and a faint smile upon her lips.
There was something very warming to her heart,
when Aunt Hulda said, with a shake of the
head,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What did I tell you? She’s a brave, good
girl; and I knew she’d come out strong when
she did come;” with a defiant glance at an invisible
somebody, who might be inclined to doubt
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson’s warm kiss of approval;
Harry’s loud “Well done, pet! I’m proud of
you!” all these were very gratifying to her. But
these outward demonstrations seemed to her
something to which she was not entitled, and so
dismayed her that she took every opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
possible to hide herself on the appearance of
visitors.</p>

<p>The destruction of the mill was a bitter disappointment
to her. She had set her heart on
earning a hundred dollars. She had reached
ninety, and the opportunity had vanished in fire
and smoke. Not all the praise of Cleverly could
compensate her for this loss. But though disappointed,
she was not disheartened; and leaving
the ninety safely locked, like the good woman
in the Scriptures, she went searching about to
discover the missing ten.</p>

<p>October came, and school opened once more,
Mr. Drinkwater in his place, and Becky and
Teddy among his pupils. For a time the young
master, with his lively interest in their studies
and out-door pastimes, his original way of making
the most laborious duties pleasant, was missed;
but Mr. Drinkwater was an earnest teacher, a
kind and honorable man, methodical in his course
of training, and under his charge the school
prospered.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson was still an inmate of Mr.
Drinkwater’s house, chafing under the restraint
of inaction, yet obedient to the wishes of the
mother to whom he owed his education, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
loving heart could not harbor the thought of a
long absence, and whose faith in the reconciliation
that would place her son in his home was
still strong. How it was to be brought about,
she knew not; but this separation was unnatural;
it must have an end. Only have patience, and
the perfect worker, in God’s good time, would
mend the broken threads.</p>

<p>One cold November afternoon, Mrs. Thompson,
with her knitting needles busily plying, sat
in the sitting-room of the little brown house,
now made very comfortable by the zealous
workers. A miniature bonfire crackled and blazed
in the broad fireplace, bountifully supplied by
Harry Thompson, who lazily lounged in a rocking-chair
before it, and divided his attention
between a frequent piling of sticks and the contents
of a portfolio in his lap.</p>

<p>Into this cosy retreat, with a rush of cold air,
burst Becky Sleeper, in her usual dashing style,
flinging her books on the sofa, her hat in one corner,
her cloak in another, her gloves on the
mantel-piece, and herself into a chair.</p>

<p>“There, Aunt Rebecca! I’ve stood this just
as long as I’m a going to. I must earn money
somehow. That hateful ten got into two of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
sums to-day, and completely ruined them. It
haunts me. Master Drinkwater asked me how
many straight lines there were in a dollar mark,
and I said ten; how many senses there were,
and I said ten; and I got well laughed at. It’s
no use. I never can succeed in anything more
until I earn that ten dollars. So don’t oppose
me, for I’m determined to get work at the woolen
mill.”</p>

<p>Having emphatically launched this alarming
threat, Becky applied herself to the task of raising
the temperature of that truthful thermometer,&mdash;her
nose,&mdash;which indicated a state of the
weather but little above zero. This she did by
a brisk application of her hand, with her eyes
fastened upon her companions.</p>

<p>“Take care, Becky; you’ll rub it off. It’s
very tender, and there’s but little of it,” said
Harry, with a laugh. “Woolen mill, indeed!
You can’t get up a blaze there; it’s brick.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of such a thing, child. There’s
no necessity for your earning money,” said Mrs.
Thompson.</p>

<p>“Necessity or not, I mean to try. To-morrow
morning I shall go there, and ask for work,”
replied Becky; “so don’t try to stop me, for I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
know it’s right for me to do all I can for the
support of the family.”</p>

<p>“Earn money in the woolen mill! Nonsense!
Why, there’s talent enough in this portfolio to
give you a handsome living, independent of the
dust and dirt of an ugly, noisy mill.”</p>

<p>“In that portfolio?” said Becky. “What do
you mean, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you know, Becky, that men
have made fortunes by their skill with the pencil
and brush?”</p>

<p>“Men! Men can do anything; but girls can’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that Becky. I know a
young lady who earns twice as much as you
ever did in the paper mill, by the use of a
pencil.”</p>

<p>“You know a young lady?” said Becky, with
a flush. “Who&mdash;where? What’s her name?”</p>

<p>Harry laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, now you’re getting inquisitive, Miss
Becky.”</p>

<p>“I know who it is, Becky,” said Mrs. Thompson.
“He’s told me all about it, and I’ll tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Mother, mother,” said Harry, with much
sternness, “secrets are sacred. You must not
tell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky began to feel decidedly uncomfortable.
Here was a young lady she had never heard of.
There was a secret, and it must not be told. O,
dear! somebody was coming between Harry and
herself. She covered her eyes with her hand;
her face was burning.</p>

<p>“What a silly goose!” she thought, and fell
to rubbing her nose again, which now indicated
a very high degree of temperature.</p>

<p>“No matter, Becky,” said Harry, noticing
her confusion; “I’ll make a clean breast of it,
and let you into the secret. When I was at
Cambridge, I boarded with a widow who had
one daughter. She was about your age, and
her name was Alice. Nice name&mdash;isn’t it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Yes&mdash;yes,” said Becky; “of
course. Didn’t she have any other name?”</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;Alice Parks. But Alice is such
a pretty name, it’s a pity it didn’t stand alone,
and have no parks about it. Alice&mdash;Alice. I
do like that name!”</p>

<p>“Why, Harry, what are you thinking of?”
asked Mrs. Thompson, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Thinking of Alice, of course,” said Becky,
with a little snap of temper. “I don’t see
what that’s got to do with a pencil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’ll come to the point&mdash;of the story,
not the pencil,” said Harry, who was evidently
enjoying the confusion of Becky. “Well, you
must know, I took a great fancy to this girl,
she was so pretty, and so gentle and obliging.
They were poor people, and found it hard
to keep up a respectable appearance, and
make their home comfortable, and table inviting.
But they did it; and it was just the nicest,
cosiest place in all the world, except home.”
Harry sobered here, and looked at his mother.
“Well, Alice had a talent for painting and
drawing, and amused herself in her leisure
moments with making sketches and water colors,
with which to adorn their rooms. I was very
grateful to them for their kindness to me; and
one day I purloined some of Alice’s drawings,
and took them into Boston. I had often played
cricket with an Englishman,&mdash;John Woodfern,&mdash;who,
I knew, was one of the best engravers
in America. I took the sketches to him, told
my story, and asked him to do something for
the girl. He took a fancy to the drawings at
once. He had a fancy for me already; and,
fortunately, he had just taken a contract to supply
a children’s magazine, then in successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
operation. He sent for Alice, took a fancy to
her, too, and at once set her to work. She is
now a successful artist. So you see, Becky,
what a young girl can do, when she has a smart,
enterprising man to help her. Ahem!”</p>

<p>“Do you think I could do that too?” asked
Becky, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course you could. John Woodfern could
never refuse such convincing proofs as are packed
away in this portfolio.”</p>

<p>“O, isn’t that splendid! I know I should
like that work,” cried Becky, jumping up and
clapping her hands. “I’ll go to Boston at
once!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on, aspiring genius!” exclaimed
Harry. “You go to Boston&mdash;one hundred and
twenty miles! Nonsense! You will stay at
home, and go to school; and when the term is
over, we’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t wait. I must have work. O,
let me go. I can find the way, and Mr. John
Woodfern, too.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I won’t aid you unless you strictly
conform to my wishes. Am I not right,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry,” said Mrs. Thompson; “it’s best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that Becky give her attention to home and
school this winter. Be patient, Becky. Harry
has opened an agreeable field of labor to you,
where you shall work in good time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Becky, I’ve discovered the mine where
lie concealed treasures of wealth, which you
shall pick with the point of a pencil. Only
wait until I give you the word.”</p>

<p>Discovered a mine? Ah, Master Harry, you’ve
reared a mine of another sort, and laid a train,
and put the match into the hands of a quick-witted
girl. Look out for a speedy explosion.</p>

<p>This new idea so bewitched Becky, that the
haunting figures ten were quickly rubbed out
of existence in her day-dreams, to give place to
the Utopian vision of fame and fortune, which
Harry had conjured for her especial benefit.
Mother and son departed. The girl sat and
gazed into the fire, with mingled feelings of hope
and disappointment. There was a bright prospect
in the future for her. Harry had said she
had the talent; her own heart told her she had
the power to accomplish this new undertaking.
But he had put the attempt a long way off, and
bade her be patient. Patience, indeed! Wait
until the end of the term&mdash;six months. In that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
time what an immense sum could be added to her
store! No; she would act at once. Patience,
as yet, was no prominent quality in her volatile
disposition; and now, when so easy a victory
over the crushing despot, dependence she so
loathed was at her will, she could not heed its
voice. She would act at once. And then the
thought of the dear friends she must disappoint
by her disobedience checked her. But again the
ambitious fever raged, and into her musings crept
Miss Alice Parks; Alice, of whom Harry was
so fond! She would go. She would see this paragon,
and know why he raved so about her.
And so, two desires mingled in her meditations,
the one born of a healthy ambition to achieve
independence, the other springing from a jealous
affection, too mischievous to be the happy tenant
of a young girl’s heart.</p>

<p>For three days duty and inclination struggled
with Becky for the mastery. In the afternoon
of the fourth day she took from her box the
carefully hoarded sum she had earned at the
paper mill, and set out for school.</p>

<p>That afternoon Captain Thompson, as was his
usual custom, was seated at his desk in the corner
of the sitting-room, making up his accounts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
for the day. He was alone; his good wife, as
was <em>her</em> usual afternoon custom, was at Mrs.
Sleeper’s&mdash;a proceeding of which the peppery
captain took not the least apparent notice. But
he knew all that had happened during the year;
knew what was happening now&mdash;the daily meetings
of his wife and son; the reformation of
Becky; his son’s brave deed in the dam; the
girl’s heroism at the burning mill. But he never
made any comments, and to all seemed an uninterested
man, wrapped in ship-building and monetary
speculations.</p>

<p>But one single thread connected him with
any interest in the Sleeper affairs. He and Teddy
Sleeper had become warm friends. Teddy had
wandered into the ship-yard one day, had watched
the ship upon the stocks, and the men at work,
and, desiring some information, had coolly walked
up to Captain Thompson, and asked a question.
The captain looked at him in surprise, then kindly
answered him, found he was interested in the
ship, and, to the astonishment of everybody, sat
down, and told him all about it. From that
time Teddy’s out-door life was passed in the
ship-yard. After school found him there, and
the captain expecting him. They drove about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
town together; and people said the boy had got
the right side of the captain, and his fortune
would be made.</p>

<p>But not a word of home dropped from Teddy’s
lips. The captain never asked questions in that
direction; and Teddy was too shrewd to peril
their friendship by treading on forbidden ground.
This day Teddy had not put in an appearance,
and for that or some other reason the captain
was in his unhappiest mood. He blotted his
ledger, spilled his ink, hitched about in his chair,
and puffed and worried, until he worked himself
into a steaming mood, that required frequent
applications of his handkerchief. In his highest
state of excitement came a knock at the front
door.</p>

<p>“Here, you, Silly, you silly thing! where are
you?” he shouted. “See who’s at the door.”</p>

<p>There was a “clap-clap-clap” in the next
room, and Silly York made her appearance.</p>

<p>“Do you want me, captain?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you. Somebody’s at the
door. If they want you, they’re welcome to you.”</p>

<p>“Do you want me to go to the door?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do. What else are you here
for? Start yourself, quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Silly stepped across the room, and opened a
door, and passed into the front entry.</p>

<p>“Here, you! mind! I’m busy, and don’t want
to see anybody. Shut that door!”</p>

<p>Silly slammed the door after her. Then the
captain heard a scream, and Silly’s voice.</p>

<p>“O, you dear little thing! I must hug you!
Come right in.”</p>

<p>The door flew open.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you I wouldn’t see anybody?”
shouted the captain.</p>

<p>“You don’t know who it is. You wouldn’t
shut her out&mdash;would you? She saved my
sister!”</p>

<p>“Hang your sister! She&mdash;” And then he
stopped, for in the room stood Silly, and the
last one he ever expected to meet in his house&mdash;Becky
Sleeper.</p>

<p>The captain looked at her in astonishment.
He knew her well. They had never spoken to
each other since that first day at school&mdash;but
he had watched her since then&mdash;was well informed
as to her progress. And yet, the bright,
young, well-dressed, graceful girl, with a smile
on her face, standing before him, took him by
surprise, and made a <em>gentle</em> man of him at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope I do not interrupt you, Captain
Thompson,” said Becky, very gently; “but I
have a little business with you; and if you
would kindly give me five minutes, I should be
very much obliged.”</p>

<p>The captain got up from his chair, and made
a low bow. It surprised him as soon as it was
done; but he couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Becky, if I can be of service
to you,&mdash;Silly, you needn’t stop.”</p>

<p>“But I want to,” said Silly. “She saved my
sister.”</p>

<p>Becky laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll come out and see you before I go,” she
said. “You’re not afraid to trust me alone with
the captain&mdash;are you?”</p>

<p>Silly looked at the captain and then at Becky,
evidently believing that it was her duty to stay
and protect Becky.</p>

<p>“Here; you start your boots&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>The captain mounted his high horse, and Silly
started for the kitchen in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Becky, what have you to say?”</p>

<p>The captain sat at his desk, and motioned
Becky to a chair. She did not obey his motion,
but came to his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Thompson, I’ve been wanting to
come to you, to thank you for being so kind to
us all, for helping&mdash;no, not helping, for you
have done everything. You have given us food
and clothing; and without your aid I don’t know
what would have become of us.”</p>

<p>“O, pshaw!” said the captain. “Is that all
you came for?”</p>

<p>“No. I came to beg your pardon for being
so much trouble to you when I was a wild tomboy.
I was young then; didn’t know how
wrong it was. I’m older now, and see my
error.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at her with increasing
wonder. Could this be the tomboy who had
snatched his whip from his hand, stolen his
horse, and given him such a chase&mdash;this little
woman, with her sweet voice and penitent air?
Or was this some new trick?</p>

<p>“Well,” said he at last, gruffly; “is that all
you came for?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Becky. “When I found that
we were indebted to you for food and clothing,
when I began to be a better girl, I felt it was
mean to let you do everything, and I, strong
and active, doing nothing; so I went to work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in the paper mill. You know how it was
destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and how a brave girl, at the risk of
her own life, saved a weak and helpless companion,”
burst out the captain. “O, I know
it!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Becky, with heightened color,
“the mill was burned. I had saved ninety dollars.
O, I did so want to make it a hundred!
But I couldn’t. I meant to bring it to you, to
pay you in part for what you had done for me
and mine. But I’ve brought you the ninety.”
And Becky suddenly laid upon the desk before
the eyes of the astonished captain her savings.</p>

<p>The captain started, then stared at the little
pile of money very hard, then harder still at
Becky, and back at the money again, until tears
began to drop from his eyes, when, without any
further ceremony, he pulled out his handkerchief,
and blubbered like a big school-boy. It
was now Becky’s turn to be surprised.</p>

<p>“O, captain, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.
I only wanted to repay you just a little
for your kindness. I didn’t mean any harm&mdash;indeed
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Becky Sleeper, you’re a little angel, and I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
an ugly old brute. Pick up your money. I
don’t want it. To think that I’ve been abusing
you all this time, and you coming in this
way to pour coals of fire on my head. I’m an
old fool! Take your money&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>“No, captain, don’t ask me to do that. If
you knew what a temptation that money has
been to me, you would never ask me&mdash;never.”</p>

<p>“Temptation! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, captain, a secret. You must
not tell, not even Aunt Rebecca. You won’t&mdash;will
you?” Becky smiled at the captain. “Honor
bright.”</p>

<p>The captain smiled at Becky. It was a good-humored
smile. They were getting on famously.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep your secret, Becky, when I get it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you must know that I’ve just
learned of a very nice way to make money, one
I should like very much. To get it in this nice
way, it is necessary to make a journey to Boston,
to see a certain man, and he would give
me drawing, for engravings. Aunt Rebecca&mdash;no,
Harry&mdash;told me of it; your Harry.”</p>

<p>The captain did not stop her at the mention
of that name, a name forbidden to be spoken in
that house. There was a little more color in
his face; but he looked steadily at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had the money to take me there, and I
was tempted to use it; tempted, O, so hard!
till at last I remembered it was your money;
and, to put the temptation from me, I brought
it to you. I didn’t want to until I had the
hundred. Now I’m glad I did. Had I gone,
I should have disobeyed Aunt Rebecca, and&mdash;Harry.”</p>

<p>“Why disobeyed Aunt Rebecca?” said the
captain, quietly dropping the other party.</p>

<p>“Because <em>they</em>,” said Becky, not relishing the
dropping game, “forbade my going until the
expiration of the school term.”</p>

<p>“How? <em>She</em> forbid you! It’s a good idea;
a nice way of earning money; and you want to
go still?”</p>

<p>“O, indeed I do, if only it was right.”</p>

<p>“Right? Of course it’s right,” said the captain,
roused at a chance for opposition. “<em>She’s</em>
no right to prevent you, and I should like to
see her do it. You want to go to Boston. You
shall go.”</p>

<p>Becky flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“O, if could only go! I know I could succeed.
But what would Aunt Rebecca and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang Aunt Rebecca!” shouted the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cutting in to prevent the addition of the
other name. “I’ve just as much right to direct
your actions as she has. I’m going to Boston
to-morrow morning. You shall go with me.”</p>

<p>Before the appearance of Becky, the captain
had no intention of taking a journey.</p>

<p>“O, that will be splendid&mdash;if I only could.”</p>

<p>“You can, and shall. Go home, get ready,
and to-morrow morning at five o’clock meet me
at the school-house. Phil shall drive us over to
Foxtown. We’ll take the cars there, and be in
Boston at one. Here, take your money;” and
the captain swept it from the desk, and put it
in her hand. “When I want it, I’ll ask for it.”</p>

<p>“But how can I ever pay you?”</p>

<p>“By shaking hands, and being friends with
the old man. You may add a kiss if you like.”</p>

<p>“A dozen!” cried Becky, throwing her arms
about the captain’s neck. “You dear, good,
kind, noble old captain!”</p>

<p>“Now, good by, little one. Be sure and be
on time to-morrow morning at five.”</p>

<p>“When the clock strikes, you’ll find me there.
Good by.”</p>

<p>Becky ran home with a happy heart, bounced
into the sitting room, and told them all about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
it&mdash;Mrs. Thompson and Harry; then ran to her
mother’s room, and told her; then to the kitchen,
and told Aunt Hulda. And such a surprised
household it would be hard to find.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson frowned, and was inclined to
put a stop to the journey; but his mother looked
happy.</p>

<p>“Our little witch has caught the captain.
Do not interfere, for out of this friendship I foresee
a happy day for you and me. ‘Let patience
have her perfect work.’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">AMONG THE WOODPECKERS.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p197.jpg" width="41" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-T">Twenty years ago, in one of the busiest
streets in bustling Boston, up three
flights of stairs, sufficiently distant from
the tumult of trade to escape its confusion, and
near enough to the sun to receive the full benefit
of its light, “John Woodfern, Designer and
Engraver,” plied his artistic trade, in the enjoyment
of a large share of public patronage. He
was a man who held the foremost place in his
profession, renowned for his skill in fastening
the fine points and delicate shades of a drawing
upon wooden blocks, whence are produced
those pictorial illustrations which often adorn,
and sometimes disfigure, books, periodicals, and
papers. He was also a man of good business
habits, and his establishment was neatly arranged,
and conducted in the most orderly manner.</p>

<p>An Englishman by birth, he brought to this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
country, besides a clear head and skilful hands,
a love for the roast-beef and ale of Old England,
a warm heart, and a jovial temper, the
latter somewhat obscured by the characteristic
fogs of gruffness and blunt speech, without which
no Briton would be content to leave his native
land. He was a large, handsome man of fifty,
with light, curly hair, surrounding a polished
pate, in whose centre flourished a single tuft of
hair; blue eyes, and a long, flowing beard.</p>

<p>His establishment was divided into two sections&mdash;his
own office at the head of the stairs,
and his work-room, from which he was only
separated by a partition, and which he could
overlook, through the door, from his seat.</p>

<p>The office contained a handsome book-case, a
desk, and his own work-table, where he did the
finest work. Its walls were adorned with fine
pictures and specimens of his work. Over the
desk was displayed, on brackets, a polished
champion cricket bat, ornamented with a silver
plate, on which glistened his name and the
match in which it was won. On his table were
the usual implements of his craft&mdash;a small stand
with a padded leather cushion, a frame in which
was fitted an eye-glass, a fine assortment of “gravers,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and blocks of wood in various stages of
completion.</p>

<p>The work-room contained three tables, at which
were seated three young men, with their eyes
screwed down to eye-glasses, diligently pecking at
drawings on wooden blocks. These young men,
“woodpeckers” by trade, were Woodferns by
name, being sons of the proprietor, and, like
their father, all good fellows and skilful workmen.
This room was plainly furnished with
three tables and a transfer press, and above
them a long shelf, on which were ranged a row
of glass globes, filled with water, used to concentrate
the light in night work.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodfern sat at his table, busily at work
putting the finishing touches to a block, when
unattended and unannounced, Miss Becky Sleeper
marched into his presence.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodfern lifted his eye from the glass,
and politely turned in his chair, with a nod to
the visitor. The young Woodferns unscrewed their
eyes from the wooden sockets in which they
were imbedded, and very impolitely stared at
the intruder.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” said Becky, in her
sweetest tones. “Will you be kind enough to
look at these drawings?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Woodfern scowled. He had been pestered
by an army of aspiring draughts<em>men</em>, of both
sexes; and the London fog was on him. He
answered shortly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want any drawings. Good
morning,” turned in his chair and applied his
eye to its artificial socket.</p>

<p>A wave of confusion rolled over Becky’s confident
spirit. The gruff voice and the abrupt
dismissal had not entered into her calculations.
But she was not disposed to quit the field without
a struggle, after so long a journey; so,
gulping down her chagrin, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand. I’ve come a long
way to get work. My friends tell me I am
competent, and I have specimens of drawing.
You’ll surely look at them.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said Mr.
Woodfern, gruffly, not deigning to raise his
eye. “I have all the draughtsmen I want; and
I never employ girls.”</p>

<p>“Why, you give Miss Alice Parks work&mdash;don’t
you?”</p>

<p>Caught. Mr. John Woodfern, how will you
answer that question?</p>

<p>“I have given her work; and a precious sight
of trouble she has made me.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/p200.jpg" width="600" height="434" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Becky makes a Hit.</span> <a href="#Page_203">Page 203</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some comfort in that to Miss
Becky’s jealous heart. Miss Alice was not quite
a paragon, after all.</p>

<p>“Once for all, I don’t want your drawings.
I’ve no time to look at them. Good morning.”</p>

<p>The tone was so chilling that a returning
“good morning” trembled on Becky’s lips. The
tears sprang to her eyes. It seemed to her for
a moment that all was lost. But, remembering
the friends she must meet with the story of her
defeat, remembering the captain patiently waiting
in the street for her return, she yet lingered,
hoping that a little reflection might produce a
change in the temper of this gruff proprietor,
and gain her a hearing. Profound silence; eyes
glued to their sockets; not even the tools of
the workmen broke the stillness, for these woodpeckers
tapped no hollow oak tree, but pecked
at solid boxwood, which emits no sound. Her
eyes roved about the room until they fastened
on the cricket-bat above the desk. They glistened
at the sight.</p>

<p>“O, what a splendid cricket-bat!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Is that yours, sir? Did you win it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Woodfern raised his head, with a faint
show of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I won it. What do you know about
cricket?”</p>

<p>“I know it’s just the most splendid game I
ever played,” replied Becky, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“You play cricket!” said Mr. Woodfern, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; but it was long ago. I was a
famous hand at it, too, though I do say it.
Please, sir, let me take it down. I won’t
hurt it.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr. Woodfern, rising from
his chair. “Handle it as much as you like.”</p>

<p>He took it from its place, put it in Becky’s
hands, and resumed his seat, watching the girl
with a lively interest, for cricket was a passion
with him age could not smother. Becky took
the bat and handled it like a true cricketer,
placing herself in graceful positions, to display
her knowledge of its use.</p>

<p>“Now, if we only had a ball!”</p>

<p>“If we had! We have,” said Mr. Woodfern,
opening a drawer in his table, and producing a
cricket ball. “Now, what next?”</p>

<p>“Bowl me a ball, and you shall see,” replied
Becky, placing herself before an imaginary
wicket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The sight of a cricketer in position was
enough to excite the enthusiastic sportsman;
and when Becky shouted, “Play!” without a
moment’s thought he bowled a swift ball. Becky
struck quick and hard; it flew across the room,
into the work-shop, and struck a glass globe.
There was a crash, and the imprisoned water
poured on to the head of the youngest woodpecker
in a miniature deluge. He sprang up,
shouting, “Help, help!”</p>

<p>“Gracious! what have I done?” faltered the
terrified Becky.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodfern colored to the tuft of the oasis
in the bald desert on his head, but quietly rose,
shut the door between the two rooms, and
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>“It’s of no consequence. Let me see your
drawings.”</p>

<p>So out of the old life a second time had come
her deliverance in time of trouble. Not altogether
wasted, after all.</p>

<p>Mr. John Woodfern took the proffered portfolio
and placed it in his lap. As he did so his
eyes met Becky’s, and the comical situation in
which he had been placed overpowered him.
He threw himself back in his chair, and burst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
into a prolonged, loud and hearty peal of laughter.
Having thus effectually dissipated the fog
he opened the portfolio, and examined its contents.</p>

<p>“So, so; this is your work&mdash;is it? Very
good, fine, excellent! You had a good teacher,
that’s evident; but you have talent, that’s still
more evident. Who is your teacher?”</p>

<p>“Harry Thompson, sir,” replied Becky.</p>

<p>“Harry Thompson of Harvard?” queried Mr.
Woodfern.</p>

<p>“He was at Harvard, sir. He’s now at Cleverly&mdash;Cleverly,
Maine; that’s where I live,”
said Becky.</p>

<p>“Indeed! It’s my old friend. He’s your
teacher at cricket, too, I’ll be bound. Why
didn’t you tell me this before?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll be kind enough to remember, sir,
you were very busy when I came in. You
didn’t give me a chance to tell you anything,”
said Becky, taking a mischievous pleasure in
reminding the engraver of his brusque behavior.</p>

<p>“Hem, hem; that’s so. I was busy, very
busy, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;what’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Rebecca Sleeper, sir. Harry calls me Becky.”</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Becky, I like your drawings;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
but the fact is you’ve had no experience in
drawing on wood.”</p>

<p>“But I could learn, sir,” said Becky, quickly.
“If you only knew how much need I have of
money, you would give me a chance&mdash;I know
you would.”</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened, and a young
lady made her appearance. She was taller than
Becky, but young and graceful, with a bright,
handsome face, lustrous black eyes, and a profusion
of dark ringlets.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Parks,” said Mr. Woodfern,
courteously.</p>

<p>Becky started, and stared at the visitor&mdash;Harry’s
paragon. It must be; it could be no
other.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Woodfern,” said Miss
Parks, gayly. “It’s the day after the fair, I
know; but you will forgive me. I couldn’t
finish them in time.”</p>

<p>The young lady unfastened her reticule, and
produced three blocks, which she laid before
the engraver.</p>

<p>“Forgive you?” said Mr. Woodfern. “I
don’t know about that. Five minutes more, and
you would have been superceded by this young
artist;” and he pointed to Becky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Parks looked at Becky, and Becky looked
at Miss Parks.</p>

<p>“Miss Parks,” said Mr. Woodfern, “this is
Miss Rebecca Sleeper, of Cleverly.”</p>

<p>A flush of surprise overspread the features of
Miss Parks.</p>

<p>“Miss Rebecca Sleeper of Cleverly! Why, it
must be Harry’s Becky. You dear little thing!
how glad I am to meet you!” and she advanced
with outstretched hands to Becky.</p>

<p>Becky met her advances with cordiality, though
the appellation of “dear little thing” from a
stranger somewhat surprised her.</p>

<p>“Harry has told me all about you. His letters
are full of praises of you; and I know all
about the adventure in the mill-dam, and the
burning of the mill. We must be good friends.”</p>

<p>So Harry wrote to her. She must be a very,
very dear friend, then; too dear for her peace
of mind. The old jealous feeling crept into
Becky’s heart, so heavy that she could scarcely
hold back her tears; but she did, and answered
nervously,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’ve heard a great deal about Miss
Alice Parks. I’m glad I met you. It will
please Harry to know that I met his dear
friend.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky didn’t mean to emphasize the “dear”
so strongly; but she noticed it brought a flush
to the face of Alice Parks. It was rather confusing,
and the two young ladies stood looking
at each other in silence.</p>

<p>“Miss Sleeper wants work. She has brought
me these sketches. Take a look at them,” said
Mr. Woodfern, handing the portfolio to Miss
Parks.</p>

<p>The young lady took it, and, seating herself
at the desk, immediately became interested in
the drawings. Just then the door of the work-room
opened, and Mr. George Woodfern entered
the office. He was a tall, handsome fellow, the
image of his father. On his entrance, Miss
Alice Parks raised her head quickly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, George,” she said, “come
and look at these drawings, and confess I’ve
found a rival at last.”</p>

<p>George Woodfern crossed the office, with a
quick step and a blushing face, and joined Miss
Alice. The two put their heads together over
the drawings, with such evident pleasure in
each other’s society, that had Alice not been
such a <em>dear</em> friend of Harry’s, Becky would
have made a match on the spot. Their conference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was long and earnest; and from their conversation
Becky was convinced that they were
pleased with her drawings. In the meantime
Mr. Woodfern made himself agreeable to Becky,
showed her how drawings were reversed on
wood, and gave her many hints regarding “shading,”
“filling in,” and the nice points of wood
engravings. The young couple at the desk at
last finished their examination.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Alice, what is the verdict?”
asked Mr. Woodfern.</p>

<p>“Employ the young lady, by all means; though
I fear ‘Othello’s occupation’s gone,’ as far as I
am concerned. She can draw ever so much better
than poor I.”</p>

<p>Becky blushed with pleasure. So Harry’s
friend was her friend too. Mr. Woodfern took
from his drawer the manuscript of two short
stories and a poem. He then selected three
blocks of boxwood from a row on his table, and
placed the whole in Becky’s hands.</p>

<p>“Miss Sleeper,” he said, “on the recommendation
of this talented young lady, I shall give
you a trial. There are two stories for children,
and a short ‘baby’ poem. The points to be
illustrated are all marked. Take them, consult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
your friend Harry Thompson, and if you send me
three satisfactory drawings within a fortnight, I
will send you my check for fifteen dollars. If
not satisfactory, I pay nothing.”</p>

<p>Becky’s heart thrilled. How kind, how good
of Mr. Woodfern! She thanked him warmly
enough, but the words seemed a long way off
from the thanksgiving that glowed in her heart.
Mr. Woodfern turned away abruptly, and entered
the work room.</p>

<p>“Now come over here and let me give you a
few hints from an experienced hand. We shan’t
want you any more, George.”</p>

<p>George Woodfern laughed, and in turn departed
to the privacy of the work-room; and the two
young ladies were left to their own deliberations.</p>

<p>All this time Captain Thompson was patiently
sitting in a carriage at the entrance, awaiting
the return of his charge. On the arrival of the
train in Boston at one o’clock, he had taken a
carriage and driven to the engraver’s. He had
been anxious to participate in the interview;
but Becky, fearing his quick temper might cause
trouble, had prevailed upon him to allow her to
be the sole carver of her fortunes with the wood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
carver. Thus far the peppery captain had enjoyed
this, to him, new sensation hugely. The bright,
cheerful, happy demeanor of the girl, her intelligent
and witty conversation, her delight in the
fresh experience of the day, had made him really
happy; and his warm heart bubbled up through
its rough exterior with desires to still further
gratify her wishes.</p>

<p>And so he waited patiently a long hour for
her return. She came bounding down the stairs,
and leaped into the carriage, her face rosy, her
eyes bright with triumph.</p>

<p>“It’s a success, captain. I’ve conquered, and
I’m carrying home lots of work.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve conquered. I knew you
would; and we’ve done it without <em>their</em>&mdash;her&mdash;help,
too,” said the captain, chuckling with
triumph. “Now let’s see&mdash;we’ve got two hours
for dinner and a drive; and then back to Cleverly.”</p>

<p>They drove to a hotel, had an excellent dinner,
took the carriage again, and Becky was
shown the Boston sights, all of which were new
revelations to the country girl, whose delight
made the old captain’s heart glow and glow
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time they took the train for Foxtown,
and then Becky related her adventure, in the
course of which Miss Alice Parks appeared upon
the scene.</p>

<p>“She’s a dear friend of Harry’s&mdash;your Harry,
captain. I shouldn’t wonder if one of these
days she should become his wife.”</p>

<p>Becky said this bravely. The captain could
not know what a throb of pain darted through
Becky’s bosom at the thought.</p>

<p>“Become his wife! Nonsense! What are
you thinking of, Becky?”</p>

<p>The captain looked fierce and angry, and
Becky saw it.</p>

<p>“Well, all I know, he calls her his dear
friend, and she calls him her dear friend, and
they write to each other; and that’s the way
lovers do&mdash;don’t they?”</p>

<p>The captain stared out of the window, moving
uneasily in his seat, snapping his teeth together
very often, all of which Becky saw and took
advantage of. A wild scheme had crept into the
girl’s head. Harry and Harry’s mother had done
much for her; it was time she should repay it.
The captain had a wilder scheme in his head,
and was in exactly the right mood to combat
the proposed alliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“He marry this girl! I’d like to see him
attempt it! I’d like to see him attempt it!”</p>

<p>This came involuntarily from the captain’s
mouth after a very long silence.</p>

<p>“Why, captain,” said Becky, “she’s a splendid
girl, and so smart with her pencil! And if
they love each other,”&mdash;here she gave a gulp,&mdash;“I’m
sure it’s only right that they should
marry. And then Harry’s so good! O, it
would be wicked to prevent his happiness. You
won’t&mdash;will you, captain?”</p>

<p>The captain said nothing, but grew more and
more uneasy; said nothing, but thought, thought
hard. What could he do? He had cast the boy
off; he was his own master. He had no power
to accomplish the wish that was in his mind.</p>

<p>“O, if you only knew how good and kind
Harry has been to me, you would never desire
to break his heart.”</p>

<p>Here Becky broke down, and commenced sobbing.
The captain started, put his arm about
Becky, and drew her head to his breast, still
looking out of the window, and saying nothing.</p>

<p>Becky’s weeping was of short duration; there
was too much at stake; and so, still lying on
the captain’s breast, with his arm about her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
softly and gently she spoke of Harry; of his
kindness to her; of his brave deeds; of the love
he had gained from all who knew him; of his
devotion to his mother; rehearsed incidents in
his college life; brought out of his boyhood
history little scraps of goodness so carefully
treasured in her grateful heart. If she had been
pleading for Harry’s life, she could not have
been more earnest and determined in the recital
of his virtues. And the captain sat there, listening,
saying nothing; and the little pleader babbled
on, unaware that at the captain’s heart the
old obstinate roots were being plucked from their
bed; that the warmth of his new love was flowing
in thawing out the long-frozen channel of
paternal affection.</p>

<p>The cars reached Foxtown, and still the captain
said nothing. The carriage was in waiting,
and an hour’s ride took them to Cleverly. The
captain was silent all the way. Phil drove
straight on to the Sleeper house. It was twelve
o’clock. There was a light in the sitting-room.
At the sound of wheels, Mrs. Thompson came
to the door. The curtain was drawn aside, and
Becky saw Harry peering out into the darkness.
She jumped from the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Won’t you come in, captain?” said Becky.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>“I shall come up to see you to-morrow, to
thank you for being so kind to-day. O, I’ve
had a splendid time. Good night.”</p>

<p>She approached the carriage, and held out her
hand. The captain grasped it.</p>

<p>“I shall come up to-morrow, captain. Shall
I come alone?”</p>

<p>Becky’s voice trembled. She had been trying
hard for a triumph. She feared she had failed.</p>

<p>“No, Becky, no. God bless you, child! Bring
him with you; bring Harry home!”</p>

<p>Phil Hague drove off down the hill at a lively
rate, Uncle Ned being started into a gallop, by
an Irish howl, which might have been heard a
mile off.</p>

<p>“Bring Harry home!” Becky heard it; Mrs.
Thompson heard it; Harry heard it. She had
triumphed, after all&mdash;this little girl, whom Mrs.
Thompson folded to her bosom, whom Harry
clasped by the hand. Mother and son might
well be happy. Reconciliation at last. But for
Becky, happiness supreme. She had accomplished
this, and hers was the hand commissioned
to bring Harry home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">DELIA SLEEPER’S SHIP COMES IN.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p215.jpg" width="36" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-B">Becky received the warm thanks and congratulations
of the happy mother and
son with a grateful heart. She had
been enabled to repay, in some part, the love
and care they had bestowed upon her. She had
conquered the stubborn father, and lifted the
cross from the shoulders of the patient wife.
But she felt that she had been but an instrument
shaped by their hands for the work, and
to them she unselfishly gave the credit of her
triumph. Not all, however; one other, who had
been her counsellor and guide; one to whom all
her thoughts and actions had been confessed;
one who, with almost supernatural wisdom had
taught her wayward feet to tread the path of
duty; who out of her own needs, had sought
peace in the boundless love of a heavenly Father,
and had brought her child into the same tender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
embrace,&mdash;the stricken mother, who for two
long years, helpless upon her bed, had borne all
so meekly and patiently; to her the grateful
daughter gave a generous share of the glory
which surrounded this unexpected reconciliation.</p>

<p>That night mother and daughter shared the
same couch. Aunt Hulda, who had a great
antipathy to strange beds, banished herself from
her accustomed pillow without a word of complaint,
glad to make the child, who had wound
herself about the queer spinster as no other had
ever been able to, happy at any cost. Alone
with her mother, Becky’s tongue flew fast and
furious with the recital of her wanderings and
workings, until the weariness of the long, strange
day overpowered her nimble organ of speech.
In the middle of a sentence, she dropped asleep,
her mother’s hand fast clasped in hers, all forgotten,
even her accustomed prayer unspoken.
But it lay there in the warm, beating, affectionate
heart, and the mother’s lips bore it to the
heavenly throne, joined to her own earnest plea
that blessings from the Unseen hand might strew
the path of life with much of happiness for her
own precious child.</p>

<p>Having eased his unhappy conscience of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
heavy load it had borne so long, the conquered
captain went home in a dazed sort of amazement
at the act which he had committed. He could
not regret it, would not have recalled his words
had he the power. There was a warming up
of his stubborn spirit when he thought of the
girl who had so craftily spread for him the net
in which he had been captured, but no desire
to loose his bonds, and escape. It was all for
the best; they would be a happy family after
the first meeting. But the first meeting bothered
the captain. What could he say to this son
who had been shut out from home so many
years? It was a serious question, and one he
could not readily answer. He went home thinking
about it: went to bed, still thinking; and
at last fell asleep, to dream of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson came home, escorted to her
door by Harry; said “Good night,” with a
happy heart,&mdash;it was to be their last parting in
this strange manner; was not surprised to find
her husband missing when she entered the sitting-room,
nor surprised to find him snoring
when she entered the sleeping-room, but had a
quiet laugh to herself as she thought how
ashamed the captain tried to appear of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
good actions. She would not disturb him for
the world; said nothing to him of the last
night’s work, the next morning, as he fidgeted
at the breakfast table, and looked everywhere
but in her face.</p>

<p>The captain did not leave the house, but gave
his whole attention to the preparation of the
speech with which he was to meet his long-absent
son. On one thing he was determined&mdash;he
would be a father still. He had been disobeyed;
it was for the son to ask pardon. He
would be cool, dignified, collected. He watched
the bridge road uneasily. At half past eight
he saw Becky leave the gate with her school-books
in her hands, and after came Harry. He
left the window at once. It was coming; it
would soon be over. He sat on the sofa, covered
his eyes with his hand, and waited. He
did not need to look&mdash;he felt their coming.
Now they were on the bridge; now they had
passed the school-house, were crossing the road,
were at the door. Yes, a ring! Mrs. Thompson
rose from her chair, looked at her husband,
with his face hidden, smiled, and passed into
the entry. Be a man, captain; be a father,
cool, dignified, collected! The door opened;
the captain rose to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good morning, captain. Here I am, and
here’s Harry.” Becky Sleeper’s voice.</p>

<p>He looked at her smiling face, beyond her to
the manly form of his son, advancing with outstretched
hand, then grasped that hand, and
shook it with nervous energy.</p>

<p>“Harry, my boy, welcome home. I have been
a poor father to you. Forgive and try me
again!”</p>

<p>He burst into tears, and sobbed like a child.
The hard heart was melted, and the cool, collected,
dignified plans, on which he had so much
depended, were dissipated at the touch of
Nature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson quietly drew Becky into the
dining-room, and shut the door, leaving father
and son to become better acquainted. The conference
was so long that Becky slipped out of
the side door, fearful of being late to school,
after a promise given to Mrs. Thompson that
she would come in and take tea with the
reunited family. She kept her promise, and
had the satisfaction of seeing Harry in his right
place, the captain in a jovial fit of good nature,
and Mrs. Thompson’s handsome face radiant with
the warm glow of a contented heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain was not quite content with this
quiet reconciliation, but must kill the fatted
calf in honor of his son’s return; and three
days afterwards the good people of Cleverly
were surprised by the intelligence that the
Thompsons were to give a party.</p>

<p>And such a party! The Thompson mansion
was lighted from bottom to top, and along the
entire reach of the various outbuildings, the
trees were hung with lanterns. A blaze of light
outside, a scene of joyous festivity within. Nobody
was forgotten. Parson Arnold, in clerical
black and white, with his wife in a new silk
dress,&mdash;the gift of Mrs. Thompson,&mdash;benignly
circulated among their flock. Mr. Drinkwater
was there, crowding Deacon Proctor into a corner,
with the discussion of a theological point.
Poor Mr. York was there, with a feeble cough,
and dilated nostrils eagerly sniffing the air, as
the door of the dining-room occasionally opened,
while his buxom wife was busily at work with
Silly, in the kitchen; and little Jenny York
was there, perched on the arm of a sofa, drinking
in with rare delight all this flow of mirth,
and light, and gay attire, and pleasant conversation.
The scholars, dressed in their best,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
played and romped about the many-roomed mansion
to their hearts’ content. And Teddy, the
captain’s favorite, dressed in a new suit,&mdash;his
patron’s gift,&mdash;proudly moved among the company,
with his sister on his arm. And Becky&mdash;light
and joyous Becky&mdash;was the queen; everywhere
she met smiles and kind words of congratulation,
for, somehow, her share in the bringing
about of this happy night had been noised abroad,
and all were anxious to do her honor. A dozen
times that night Captain Thompson had clasped
her hand.</p>

<p>“It’s all your work, Becky!”</p>

<p>A dozen times the face of Harry Thompson
had beamed upon her, “Thanks to you, Becky!”
And every look of the happy mother, as she
moved among her guests, was a silent prayer of
thankfulness to Becky.</p>

<p>It was a gay night for Cleverly; and when
the door of the dining-room was thrown open,
and the guests assembled about the tables,&mdash;whose
crooked legs seemed ready to snap under
their burdens of good cheer,&mdash;a night of feasting
such as Cleverly had never before witnessed.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings, Teddy, dazzled
by the tempting array of edibles, quite forgot
his gallantry, and slipping from Becky’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
side, went in pursuit of a far-off frozen pudding.
His place was quickly supplied by Harry Thompson.</p>

<p>“Well, pet, enjoying yourself, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Enjoying myself! Why, Harry, I never was
so happy in all my life&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“I have a message for you from a dear friend&mdash;Alice
Parks.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Have you heard from her lately?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I received a letter from her to-day;
and it’s so full of praises of one Becky Sleeper,
that I am really jealous.”</p>

<p>Becky made no reply. Somehow, she did not
feel quite so happy now. It seemed to her that
they were getting along very pleasantly, without
having this young lady added to their company.
He was jealous, too, of her evident fondness
for the little girl she had befriended. He
must be very much in love with her, then. She
looked up, and met such a mischievous twinkle
in his eyes, that she laughed aloud at her own
folly.</p>

<p>“O, Harry, you do like to torment me. I
hope you won’t plague her so, when you get
her.”</p>

<p>“When I get her? O, no, Becky, I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a different man, a very different man&mdash;when I
get her.”</p>

<p>Still the same mischievous look. What could
he mean? Was it all settled, then? Was he
sure of her? She turned away, sick at heart,
disappointed at she knew not what. She only
wished she was at home.</p>

<p>“Here, Becky, come with me. I have purloined
a big dish of goodies, and hidden it under
the sofa in the sitting-room. Come with me;
we shall be alone in there.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the captain; a welcome
relief to her embarrassed position. Smilingly she
took the arm of her friend, and soon they were
comfortably snuggled together on the sofa, and
the captain’s teasing offspring forgotten.</p>

<p>“Ah, Becky, there’s lots of young and gay
fellows about to-night; but I know you will
spare a few moments for the old man,” said the
captain, as he produced his “goodies” from
beneath the sofa.</p>

<p>“Indeed I will. O, you are so kind to make
Harry’s coming home so pleasant to all of us!”</p>

<p>“Yes, chatterbox; and you were kind to give
me the opportunity to do it. But tell me, what
shall we do with him, now we’ve got him
home?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why keep him, of course. You don’t think
he’ll run away&mdash;do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he will. He’s talking now of going
to Boston to study law. It’s all nonsense. He
needn’t do anything but just spend my money.”</p>

<p>“He never would be satisfied with such a life
as that. He’d make a splendid lawyer, I know.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but he can study with Squire Barnes,
here at home. There’s few lawyers can beat
him in an argument. If I could only find some
way to keep him here! He’s old enough to
marry.”</p>

<p>Becky winced.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s thinking of that, and wants to
be in Boston, near Alice Parks.”</p>

<p>“Alice Fiddlesticks!” shouted the captain,
upsetting his plate. “Don’t talk nonsense,
Becky.”</p>

<p>“He had a letter from her to-day,” said Becky,
innocently unmindful of the fact that she might
be betraying a secret.</p>

<p>“He did&mdash;did he?” said the captain, growing
red in the face. “I’ll put a stop to that.
He shan’t marry that girl; I won’t have it. I’ll
just have him in here, and know what he
means.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He jumped to his feet, dropping his plate.</p>

<p>“O, captain, don’t say anything to him
to-night,” cried Becky, seizing the captain’s arm,
and preventing his leaving the room. “He
would hate me if I made trouble between him
and you; and I love him so dearly! Don’t captain,
don’t. You’ll break my heart.”</p>

<p>The little goose dropped the captain’s arm,
and fled to the sofa, covered her face with her
hands, and sobbed aloud. The captain stared at
her. It was evident to him she did love Harry;
and his hatred of Miss Alice Parks grew stronger.
But it was no time for a scene; and he sat
himself down beside Becky, put his arm around
her, and penitently promised to be quiet, and
not interfere. He gradually succeeded in bringing
Becky into a lighter mood; and as the
refreshed company from the dining-room drifted
that way, the party on the sofa were hugely
enjoying a joke the captain had perpetrated for
the benefit of his companion.</p>

<p>In due time the dining-room was cleared of
the fragments of the feast, the tables rolled
against the walls, and, with Harry as master of
ceremonies, a succession of familiar in-door pastimes
was inaugurated for the younger members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of the company. “Fox and Geese,” “Blind
Man’s Buff,” and “Hunt the Slipper,” gave
pleasant entertainment to the light-hearted revellers.</p>

<p>Nor did the happy occasion end here. Mr.
Clairborn, the chorester, had been running
about the room, watching Mr. Arnold with a
feverish excitement he found hard to control.
At last that worthy individual, to set a good
example to his parishioners, tucked his good wife
under his arm and departed. Then Mr. Clairborn
ran to the sofa and from behind it took a
long green bag, of peculiar shape, and from the
bag he took&mdash;a fiddle, to the amazement of
certain staid neighbors, who thought the man
crazy. Of these people he took not the least
notice, but, with his instrument in full view,
marched to the head of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a shout, “A dance! a
dance!” A dance in Deacon Thompson’s house!
He’d soon put a stop to that. Anxious looks
were cast in his direction; but he was busy
talking to Mrs. York, and took not the least
notice of what was going on about him.</p>

<p>“Hull’s Victory; take your partners!” shouted
Mr. Clairborn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain did not move; the company did.
There was a moment’s bustle, and then Mr.
Clairborn’s bow went dancing across his fiddle,
and twenty happy couples danced up and down
the dining-room. Then came “Virginia Reel.”
“Money Musk,” “Fisher’s Hornpipe,” and a regular
succession of good old contra dances, with
a merry accompaniment of glib tongues and
happy laughter. O, captain, you are laying
yourself open to a severe reckoning at the next
church meeting. Little cared the stubborn captain
what might come of his folly. “Eat, drink,
and be merry.” The lost son was home again.
They might make a bonfire of his old house;
but they should never forget this night.</p>

<p>In the height of their merriment, a strange
figure dashed into their midst. It was Aunt
Hulda.</p>

<p>“Stop, quick! Where’s Becky Sleeper?”</p>

<p>The music ceased, and all gazed at the weird
figure which, with glaring eyes and dishevelled
hair, stood in their midst.</p>

<p>“Here, Aunt Hulda, what’s the matter?” and
Becky stepped from her place among the dancers.</p>

<p>“O, Becky! Becky! home, quick! Your
mother’s had another shock!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Becky screamed, and ran after Aunt Hulda,
who immediately turned and left the house.
There was no more dancing: the company quietly
dispersed. When the last guest had departed,
Mrs. Thompson put on her shawl, and with
Harry and the captain, started for the house
across the bridge. The church clock struck
eleven.</p>

<p>At that very moment the train entered the
depot at Foxtown, and from it jumped a stout,
long-bearded weather-bronzed man.</p>

<p>Aunt Hulda was right. A second stroke of
paralysis had fallen upon Delia Sleeper, sealing
the lips that had so often of late uttered tender
words of love to the heart-broken child, who
now lay weeping upon her breast. There was
no sign of life upon that pale face, save in the
eyes that wandered from face to face, and sought
the open door with a wishful look. They were
all about her,&mdash;Aunt Hulda, Mrs. Thompson,
Harry, the captain, Teddy,&mdash;all anxiously waiting
the verdict of Dr. Allen. Soon the doctor
made his appearance, soberly examined his patient,
gave a few whispered instructions to Aunt Hulda,
and left the room, followed by the captain.</p>

<p>“O, mother, speak to me! only speak to me!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
sobbed Becky. “Tell me you forgive me for
leaving you. I didn’t know this was coming&mdash;indeed
I didn’t. Forgive me dear, dear mother!”</p>

<p>No sound from the lips, but the eyes sought
the dear face with a troubled look.</p>

<p>“Nay, Becky,” said Mrs. Thompson, “you
have done no wrong. It was your mother’s
wish that you should go to-night.”</p>

<p>The roving eyes thanked the good woman for
her interpretation of their language.</p>

<p>“No, no; it was wrong to leave her. She’ll
die, and leave me&mdash;I know she will.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Becky,” said Aunt Hulda. “The
doctor said she’d rally. Great care is necessary.
Another shock would be fatal.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Becky grew very quiet, but
knelt at the side of the bed, with her eyes
fastened upon her mother’s. Mrs. Thompson
tried to take her from the room, but she waved
her off. Notwithstanding the doctor’s whispered
hope, dread forebodings filled the hearts of all
the watchers of that pale face, with its gleaming
eyes. For an hour that room was as quiet
as if beneath a spell. No one there could be of
the least assistance; yet not one departed. So
quiet, that the far-off noise of wheels at that
late hour startled them; and a sudden light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
dilated the watchful eyes upon the bed. They
fastened upon the door, full of expectancy and
hope.</p>

<p>The wheels drew nearer, nearer yet; they
stopped before the house. A moment after there
came a hurried tread; the door was thrown
open, and in the room stood the long-expected
husband,&mdash;Cyrus Sleeper.</p>

<p>“Delia, wife! home, home at last!”</p>

<p>Those wishful eyes fastened upon his face an
instant, gleamed brighter still, and then closed&mdash;closed
forever. Their work was done.</p>

<p>Faithful eyes; let them be covered. They
have watched and waited for the ship; it has
come, freighted with treasure; but not to enrich
that loving heart. The ship has come, to
meet another leaving an earthly port&mdash;God’s
invisible bark, bearing one more purified soul
out into the sea of eternity, unto the haven of
heavenly bliss. Speedy shall be thy voyage,
gentle mother. Behind thee are tears and lamentations,
and the memory of thy patient endurance
of adversity’s long trial; before thee lies the new
life. Freed from earthly bonds, eager to do thy
Maker’s work in the great hereafter, loving
spirits, with glad hosannas, shall welcome thy
coming to the port of peace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="mediumfont">TWO YEARS AFTER.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/p231.jpg" width="41" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi-T">The little brown house on the hill
vanished; in its place stands a modern
mansion, broad and high, attractively
arrayed in white and green, with commodious
out-buildings, broad walks and flower-beds about
it; a wide and well-cultivated vegetable patch
stretching to the water, with a young orchard,
handsome and vigorous, away to the right.
There are evidences of abundant means in its
laying out, and of rare taste in its nurture. It
is still the Sleeper place, and Captain Cyrus
Sleeper is the head of its household. When the
earthly remains of Delia Sleeper had been laid
away in the quiet churchyard, and the serious
faces of the gossips of Cleverly had resumed
their wonted aspect, eager was the desire of
these curious people to know the cause of the
long absence of the captain; and the stricken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
household were not long left to the solitude they
coveted.</p>

<p>The captain’s story was very brief. Generally
a man of voluble tongue, the sad scene which
had greeted his return home seemed to have so
shocked him, that his communications were
abrupt, often rude, and entirely unsatisfactory to
the news-seekers.</p>

<p>He had been to California, among the first
adventurers to the Golden State, had struck gold
with the earliest, and at the end of a year’s
absence from home, returned to San Francisco
well laden with treasure. Here a thirst for speculation
took hold of him; and, without experience,
he became the gull of a set of sharpers,
and in less than three months was penniless.
Back to the mines again, but with a sterner
experience. The mines were overcrowded, gold
was harder to find, and still harder to keep.
Yet he worked away for eighteen months,
recovered all he had lost, and came back to San
Francisco, determined to start for home. But
this time he had a partner; and before the
division of the hard-won nuggets was made, his
partner, thinking a whole loaf better than half
a loaf, vanished with the joint stock, leaving
Sleeper with barely enough to reach home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time news of the gold discoveries in
Australia reached California, and thirsty Sleeper
started for the new fount, to fill his empty
pitcher. His good luck returned to him, and,
after long and patient delving, the coveted
treasure was in his grasp. Taught wisdom by
experience, he banked his gold as fast as gained,
and when he reached Boston was worth at least
three hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>He reached home, a wealthy man, to find his
wife dying of neglect; to find she had not heard
from him for years. He could not understand
it. Had he written? Certainly, often. But no
letters had ever reached her. Yet when closely
questioned, it appeared he had only written
twice, being a man with whom penmanship was
a most unmanageable craft, and had entrusted
his epistles to the care of others. He was a fair
type of too many sailors; the bonds of affection
held strong at home; but away, the driving
winds and tossing waves snapped them, and they
were useless to guide the giddy rover.</p>

<p>Cyrus Sleeper mourned his wife deeply for a
while, and then his bustling spirit set itself to
work. He was proud of his daughter; gazed
upon her with admiration; watched her quick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
steps and ready tact in household affairs, and
swore a big sailor oath to himself that she should
have the best home in Cleverly. He kept his
word. He went to Captain Thompson, and asked
him to take his child until he could build. The
captain took them all&mdash;his friend, Becky, Teddy,
even Aunt Hulda; and for a year they were the
inhabitants of his house.</p>

<p>Then the old house came down, and the new
structure went up. With ready money and a
pushing spirit, Cyrus Sleeper found men and
materials ready at his command; and after a
year’s absence the family returned to the old
spot, to find it entirely metamorphosed, as if by
the hands of an enchanter.</p>

<p>During this year Becky had not been idle.
Though the necessity for work had passed away,
the spirit of independence still hovered about her.
She had made a contract with Mr. Woodfern,
and she determined to fulfil it. She found drawing
on wood no easy matter; but she resolutely
persevered, and in a fortnight sent her three
blocks to Mr. Woodfern. Two were accepted;
the third was returned, with the concise message,
“Try again,” and matter for three new
illustrations. Emboldened by her success, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
worked at her drawing through the winter, with
a constantly growing love for her task, and ever
increasing show of improvement, until no blocks
were returned, and the engraver clamored for
more.</p>

<p>Nor did her usefulness end here. Eager to
relieve Mrs. Thompson of a part of the burden
which her large family entailed upon her, she
dashed into domestic affairs with alacrity, and
proved an able assistant, and a ready solver of
the mysteries of housekeeping. Another loving
and holy task&mdash;the care of her mother’s grave&mdash;was
never neglected. Daily the grave, which
bore a white slab at its head, on which the
name “Mother” was carved, was visited by her
on whose heart that dear name was so indelibly
engraved; and twining vines and fresh white
flowers gave token of the fond affection of the
motherless child.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Hulda having thus unexpectedly
become an inmate of Captain Thompson’s house,
where she was treated with the utmost respect,
had a return of her old grumbling programme,
to the dismay of Becky. Having no active
employment to keep her mind off herself, it was
no wonder that the appetite she had so long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
supplied should grow restive. But not until the
spinster spoke of going over to “help” Parson
Arnold’s wife, did Becky hit upon a cure for
her nervousness. Then it suddenly occurred to
her that there were others who needed real
“help,” and so, taking Aunt Hulda to her chamber,
she spread out a neat little campaign of
charity, in which Aunt Hulda, furnished with a
well-filled purse, and unlimited freedom to call
upon her for supplies, was to enact the <em>role</em> of
an angel of mercy, because Becky was “so busy.”
This dispelled the vapors at once. The homely
angel took up her mission with alacrity; and
many a poor creature in Cleverly blessed the
dear old maid for her ministrations, with tears
of gratitude.</p>

<p>When the new house was finished, and they
had moved in, Cyrus Sleeper walked over to
settle with Captain Thompson. He found this
no easy matter. Captain Thompson would not
listen to it. He had induced Delia Sleeper to
embark with him in speculation; she had lost
all, and it was his duty to care for her and her
children. As for the living during the year,
they had taken them as visitors; were glad to
have them, and would take them again willingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Sleeper was determined, and Captain
Thompson obstinate; and they came to pretty
high words, and parted, vowing they would
never speak to each other again. Becky tried
to reconcile them, and at last made them agree
to leave the matter to a referee for settlement,
she to name the party. To their surprise, she
named Aunt Hulda. That distinguished character
immediately locked herself in her room,&mdash;for
she had an apartment in the new house.</p>

<p>For a week she worked at accounts, partly
drawn from her wise old head. At the end of
that time she called the two captains before her,
and placed in their hands a long bill. “Captain
Sleeper debtor to Captain Thompson,” in
which every item of provisions and clothing,
that Captain Thompson had paid for, figured,
and the sum total of which amounted to seven
hundred dollars, which Captain Sleeper must
pay. Captain Sleeper wrote a check, payable to
the order of Captain Thompson, for one thousand
dollars&mdash;he wouldn’t pay a cent less.
Captain Thompson took the check, without a
word, wrote across the back of it, “Pay to
Hulda Prime,” and handed it to the astonished
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the fee for your work. Now don’t
let’s hear any more about a settlement.”</p>

<p>The two captains shook hands; Becky hugged
Aunt Hulda, and told her they had served her
just right. The spinster tried to speak, but
couldn’t, for her tears. The matter was satisfactorily
settled forever, and the hitherto penniless
referee found herself no penniless bride, when
the new mill being in successful operation, Mark
Small took her to a home of her own, and the
romantic episode in the life of an old maid
became one of the chronicles of Cleverly.</p>

<p>Teddy Sleeper, by mutual consent of the two
captains, was regularly apprenticed to the trade
of ship carpentering&mdash;an occupation which soon
reduced his weight, enlarged his muscles, and
increased his appetite. Hard work dissipated
his once sluggish disposition; a love for his trade
aroused ambition; and Captain Thompson had
the satisfaction of knowing his <em>protege</em> would in
time become a successful ship-builder.</p>

<p>Harry Thompson entered the office of Squire
Alden, to study law, to the delight of his father,
and took to work so earnestly that the scheming
captain could not find it in his heart to risk
another rupture by opening his batteries for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
purpose of defeating the alliance which he had
many reasons for believing was at some future
time to be completed between his son and Alice
Parks.</p>

<p>Two years after the death of her mother found
Becky Sleeper mistress of her father’s home,
with unlimited means at her command, yet careful
and prudent in its management, relying upon
her tried friends&mdash;Aunt Hulda and Mrs. Thompson&mdash;for
advice; always cheerful, yet ever earnest,
doing her best for the comfort of all about
her, moving easily in her exalted sphere, with
all the roughness of her tomboy days quite worn
away, and the graces of gentle, cultivated womanhood
shining all about her.</p>

<p>Cleverly folks were prouder of the young
housekeeper than they had been of the brave
girl. Captain Sleeper was a social man, and
would have a lively house, and many and brilliant
were the gatherings over which Becky presided.
Yet she liked the neighborly company of Captain
Thompson, or Aunt Rebecca, or Harry best
of all. The latter made himself quite at home
there, and of course Cleverly people talked about
it, and made a match at once.</p>

<p>Yet the young people spoken of hardly acted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
like lovers. They were not in the habit of
secreting themselves among the window curtains,
or wandering down the walks hand in hand, or
conversing in that mysterious language of the
eyes so tender and significant. And so at last
the good people believed themselves mistaken,
and the wife-seeking young fellows of the neighborhood
took courage, and laid siege to the
richly-endowered heart of Miss Becky Sleeper.</p>

<p>One of the number&mdash;Herbert Arnold, son of
the pastor, a slim, delicate young man&mdash;became
a frequent visitor, and threw longing glances
through the glasses of his gold-rimmed spectacles,
and paid much attention to Aunt Hulda,
whose pies were his exceeding delight, and
listened to the captain’s long yarns without a
yawn, and went away firmly convinced he was
making an impression upon the heart of Becky.
But the young lady shut the door after him,
with a smile, and turned away, to dream of
somebody else.</p>

<p>The last rays of an October sun were decking
the broad piazza of the house with a golden
glow. It had been a busy day with Becky, and,
a little weary, she threw open the door, to
breathe the air, after her long season of labor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Sitting on the steps, tracing in the sand before
him with a cane, was Harry Thompson, evidently
busy with some problem. With a smile, she
cautiously slipped behind him, and looked at his
work. No difficult problem tasked his cane;
only a name written in the sand&mdash;“Becky
Sleeper.” She started back, and a flush deeper
than the sun could paint overspread her face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/p240.jpg" width="472" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Harry writes in the Sand.</span> <a href="#Page_243">Page 243</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Why, Harry! you here?”</p>

<p>The name quickly disappeared from the sands,
and a flushed face turned towards her.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;O, yes&mdash;how do you do? Nice evening&mdash;isn’t
it?” answered Harry, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world are you doing
there? Why don’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“Thank you; not just now. I’m very busy
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Then perhaps I’d better retire. I
wouldn’t for the world interrupt your <em>new</em> occupation,”
said Becky; and a merry laugh rippled
on her lips.</p>

<p>“That’s right; laugh, Becky. It’s an old
occupation, that, very becoming to you,” returned
Harry. “It reminds me of the days when we
were both so young and innocent. Ah, those
good old days! We were great friends then,
Becky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope we are good friends now, Harry.”</p>

<p>“Of course we are. But now you are quite a
woman, full of cares; yet a brave, good, noble
little woman, rich and courted.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to those who trained the vine once
running to waste, flatterer. What I am I owe
to those who loved me; what I might have
been without their aid, not all the riches in the
world could have prevented.”</p>

<p>“True, Becky. By the by, I have a letter
from an old friend will interest you. Oh such
startling news?”</p>

<p>Becky colored, yet compressed her lips resolutely.
Always that old friend.</p>

<p>“From Alice Parks?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, from Alice Parks. You know what an
interest I take in that young lady’s welfare,
and you shall share in my delight. Look at
that.”</p>

<p>He handed her a letter; she took it with a
pang of uneasiness; mechanically unfolded it.
There dropped from it two cards, fastened with
white ribbon. Harry picked up the cards and
handed them to her. She glanced at them.</p>

<p>“O, Harry! she’s married!”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Mr. George Woodfern and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Alice Parks, after a long and patient courtship,
have united their destinies. The <em>designing</em> young
woman having <em>engraved</em> herself upon the heart
of the young engraver, the new firm is ready
for business.”</p>

<p>“O, Harry, I’m so sorry!” faltered Becky.</p>

<p>“Sorry? for what, pray? They’ll be very
happy.”</p>

<p>“Sorry for you, Harry. They will be happy;
but you&mdash;you&mdash;you loved her so dearly&mdash;didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Sorry for me? Well, I like that!” And
Harry indorsed his liking with a hearty laugh.
“Loved her? Why, Becky, what put that into
your head?”</p>

<p>Becky was confused. She thought of the
uneasiness she had caused Captain Thompson by
her suspicions, to say nothing of the uneasiness
she had caused herself.</p>

<p>“Why, Harry, you wrote to her, and she
wrote to you; and I told your father that I
thought you were engaged.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! that accounts for the old gentleman’s
fidgets when I received a letter. No, Becky, I
admired, and do admire, that young lady; but
love her! make her my wife! I never had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
least idea of it. My heart is engaged elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my misfortune, then. I have always
loved a dear old playmate, one whom I have
watched grow into a strong and beautiful woman;
whom I would not wrong with the offer of my
hand until I had fully proved my power to win
my way in the world. Do you know her,
Becky?”</p>

<p>He still sat there, looking up into her face,
with eyes so full of strong and tender love, that
Becky was almost sure she saw her own image
mirrored there; and her heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>“Becky, must I say more?”</p>

<p>He looked at her mischievously; then turned
and traced upon the sands the name again&mdash;“Becky
Sleeper.”</p>

<p>“O, Harry, Harry! I’m so glad, so glad!”</p>

<p>She sank down by his side; his arm was about
her, and her head was on his breast. Very much
like lovers, now. So thought Mrs. Thompson,
as she stepped inside the gate; so thought two
old fellows, who just then came from the barn
towards them.</p>

<p>“Look there, Cyrus, old boy; there’s poaching
on your ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, Paul&mdash;if my dove must go. It
will be tenderly nurtured there.”</p>

<p>And so, in due time, the “Tomboy” became
a lovely bride; and the name Harry Thompson
had shaped upon the sand, was written in the
old family Bible; and another generation of
Thompsons sported in the orchard, and plucked
fruit from the old tree where Becky Sleeper had
long ago been found Running to Waste.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
